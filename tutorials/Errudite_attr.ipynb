We took a height of .2 meters and the potential energy was .6 Joules. Then we took a height of .4 meters and we saw that the potential energy increased to 1.2 Joules. This was how we discovered an increase in height gives you a higher potential energy. When you have friction on the initial drop, the potential energy at the top of the hill will NOT equal the kenetic energy at the bottom of the drop.

At the top, there is no Kinetic Energy because all the Potential Energy has yet to transform into Kinetic Energy. The higher the initial drop height got, the more potential energy you had.  Also, all the potential energy had transformed into Kinetic energy. Also, when the mass went up, so did the potential energy.

To be exact, in the simulation, the potential energy was 3.9 joules. When the car moves down the drop, the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. But, in the real world, some kinetic energy will be lost to heat energy, but the total amount of energy is the same. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Since the mass is small, this also affects the total energy. This is because more mass means more potential energy and kinetic energy.\n",

At the top of the hill, they will experience  the feeling of weightlessness. They wont stay up there long before being shot back down the hill, reaching a fast speed. Finally, after traveling a short distance the brakes will be added to the cart and it will come to a stop, which will give the riders one last feeling of force. Despite all these amazing features, we believe that the best aspect of our design is the fact that it is completely frictionless, so after the drop, no more energy needs to be added to the cart, making it very environmental and economical friendly. The combination of all these thrills will give the riders an experience they will never forget.\n",

We wanted as much potential energy as possible so that we knew it would make it over all the hills and through all the loops. Because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states that energy can’t be created or destroyed, the car still has the same amount of energy at the bottom as it did al the top of the drop.

Right at the top of the initial drop it will hold the cart just so it is at al most 80º Then hold it for 3 to 5 second to make it more intresting The Force used to pull the cart from the bottom to the Top will have to be big enough so it can pull it all the way back threw the track so people can rid it again\n",

Another reason we chose a high initial drop height is when height increases, there is an increase in speed. the mass of our car is 50kg. The initial drop is perfect because the amount of Kinetic energy at the bottom isn’t too close to the amount of potential energy at the top.

      "Our firm suggests to use the Car Mass of 0.4 kg. The reasoning behind our choice of Car Mass is the reasonable amount of Potential Energy (pe). For example, a 0.4 kg mass resulted in 3.9 J of pe. A greater Car Mass of 0.8 kg  resulted in 7.8 J of pe. For all of these trials we used a lift height of 1 meter. We suggest an Initial Drop Height of 1 meter. In our trials as Drop Increased the pe increased. For instance, with a Drop Height of 0.4 meters the Initial PE and final ke were 3.9 J. Equal initial pe and final KE showed the law of conservation of energy. As the hill height increased, the PE increased at the hill top. Our chosen hill height was safer than a lower hill height, because the speed at the top was less. For example, a hill height of 0.6 (m) results in a hill top PE of 2.3 J . The PE of this lower hill is slightly less at 1.2 J. The ke at hill base was also similar due to the lack of friction (3.9J), as was (the) ke at hill top (1.6J).\n",

      "The first thing we had to decide was the mass and the lift height. Our team decided on a mass of .74kg and a lift height of 1m. We chose that mass because we didn't want it to be too heavy because then it wouldn't be able to make it over the loops. When mass was .2kg the Potential energy at the top was 2J, and then we increased the mass to .4kg the potential energy increased to 3.9J. The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill with too much force. The next thing we decided on was the initial drop height, and our company chose 1m. Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form. The third thing the team decided on was the hill height. We chose a height of .62m. We wanted to make it high for more fun, but if it was any heigher the car wouldn't have enough energy to make it over. If our hill height was heigher than the initial drop there's mo way the car would make it over. The car wouldn't have energy to make it over a hill heigher than the initial drop because since energy cannot be created the amount of energy you have from the initial drop will stay the for the hill. you can't create more energy to get over a higher hill.\n",

When my corporation changed the car mass to 0.8, we found out that the was potential energy was 7.8J.

      "To start off with, our firm chose .6kg as a car mass. One of the reasons is that during the experiments, 2 kg as a car mass reached 2 J for potential energy,.4 kg had 3.9 J for potential energy & .8 had 7.8 J as a potential energy, so for an extra experiment, the car mass of .6 had reached 5.9 J , and 5.9 J seemed to be the perfect number, as the level would be high enough to make it up the hill, and not to take up more money for more track, because it takes P.E. to make it up the hill, as potential energy goes down, kinetic energy goes up, as kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object, an potential energy is the energy an object something potentially has, and since, as the law of conservation proves, since energy cannot be created, nor destroyed, only transferred, P.E. is transferred to become K.E. and with not friction, like in the simulation, k.E. and P.E. would be equal, but adding friction, like in the real life experiments, P.E. and K.K. will be different, so as some of the K.E. is ‘lost’ shall we say, (Not literally, as I said that energy cannot be destroyed, nor created) then it’ll take more P.E. to make it up the hill, but not so much as to have to add more track for it to stop, because adding more track is costly.\n",
      "        The firm chose for the initial drop height to be .8 m, and here’s why. You see, two things can affect the P.E. needed for it to make it up the hill, the car mass, and the lift height. Now, the initial drop affects the P.E. about the same as car mass does, for example, 0.2m=2J, 0.4m=3.9J, 0.6m=5.9J, and 0.8m=7.8J. Did you notice a pattern? It’s the same for mass except it’s kg instead of m, so basically, initial drop affects P.E. just as much as car mass does, but when both are considered, they can create a bigger number, after all, 5+5 is 10, not 5. Anyways, we chose 0.8 as an initial drop, (Let’s label it I.D from now one.) because, it’ll give us enough P.E to make it over the hill, like with the car, plus, in this, we kept and eye on speed, mostly because mass has no effect on speed so we didn’t mention that ; but height affects speed and a high level of speed can be dangerous. For the hill, the firm chose the height to be .6 m as it allowed the car to go over the hill.\n",

      "The mass my firm choose was .6kg because .6 kg will have P.E. increase (1.6j 3.1j 4.7j 63.j)-top. It is also  because the way our heights are, so if we choose a 1 kg mass and a .8m hill height the car stops at the very top. And that is somewhat frightening for passengers.  So we set our mass for .6kg then it will make our efficiency level 100% because Kenetic Energy was 4.7j, and Potential Energy is 0j. Our initial drop height is .7m that is Average, And if we had .6m drop height our car would not have enouigh energy to get over the hill, while on contrary if we had .8m drop height our car would accel the speed limit on the coaster. Our Hill height is at .6m. We chose this height because our initial Drop height .7m and if we put our hill height at the .7m initial drop height our car will never get over the hill, And if we put it at .5m-4m than our car will exceed the speed limit. I noticed that P.E at top K.E at top and K.E at bottem were the same through all the trials. \n",

We chose 0.6m because with the initial drop height at 0.8m and the friction of real life the hill could have been a little taller but not much, also with it taller It was way too slow and just barely made it over the hill.

      "0.4 kg. would be the best amount for car mass. To start off with, 0.4 kg would be the best mass for the car because, since the car is lighter than .8 kg. Also, since the initial drop height isn’t too high, you don’t have to decrease the mass anymore. Also, the car is 0.4 kg, which is heavier than 0.2 kg. So at the top of the initial drop, the car will have 3.9 J for the initial potential energy instead of only 2 J. Mass does not affect speed so this doesn’t play a role. 0.4 kg for the car mass doesn’t take as much energy as heavier car masses. And the increased car mass increases KE( the energy of motion), so the car will go fast and create a thrilling experience.\n",

      "One meter would be the best height for the initial drop. First of all, the increased height increases potential energy. So the potential energy at the top of the initial drop with a height of 1m would be 9.8 J. This amount of PE is greater than the .2m height, the .4m height, the .6m height, and the .8m height. The potential energy for those heights were 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.8 J. Also, the KE at the bottom of the drop was increased also for 1 m as the height. The KE was 9.8 J. This amount of KE is greater than the other heights. The KE at the bottom of those hill heights was only 2 J, 3.9 J, 5.9 J, and 7.9 J. Lastly, the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed but can be transfered to different dorms. This relates to the initial drop height because the height needs to be tall enough so the car has enough energy to go over the hill. If the initial drop height was increased any more, the car would go to fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "0.5 m would be the best height for the hill. One reason this height is the best is because 0.5 m is not tall than the initial drop height (1m) so the car has enough energy (about 4 J) to make it over the hill. If the hill was taller, say, 1m, and the initial drop was also 1m, than the car wouldn’t be able to make it over the hill. This also is related to Law of Conservation of Energy because energy cannot be created in the car to go over the hill.

The mass of .74kg isn't too high to be unsafe because if Potential energy was too high the car would go down the hill. When the lift height increased by .2m the potential energy increased at the same rate as it did for mass. There will not be an increase in speed, even if mass increases because speed increases with an increase in drop height.

Both potential energy, at the top, and kinetic energy, at the bottom, increased with a higher height. They increased by 2J every time the height went up by .2m. The total energy is the Potential energy plus the Kinetic energy, so that also increased. Potential energy is highest at the top of the drop because it's energy at rest. Kinetic energy is highest at the bottom because it's energy at motion. Energy can't be created or destroyed but can change it's form.

We chose this height because the hill can’t be taller than the initial drop according to the Law of Conservation of Energy. \n",

This specific initial drop/ lift height was chosen because if the height is less than or the same height as the hill height (.9-0 m) the car will either not be able to make it over the hill or it will have dangerous levels of speed.

My group and I have chosen the initial drop height to be 1 meter. When we did the tests, none of the manipulated variables was 1 meters. We decided to put the initial drop up one more level to 1 meter. To make sure that it is safe, my group and I tested it with the simulation. My group and I chose the hill height to be 0.8 meters for a few reasons. First of all, we tried to make the hill smaller then the initial drop. The results of that ( we tried .4 m) were bad because the speed was too high. Then we had the hill be .6 meters. But that wasn’t;t too good. Then we tried .8 meters which had an red flags for the speed. That made us decide that this was best.\n",
