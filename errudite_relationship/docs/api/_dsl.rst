Domain Specific Language (DSL)
==============================

Errudite has a DSL language that: 

1. Use primitive functions that run on targets to extract fundamental instance metadata 
   (e.g., ``length(premise)`` returns the length of a question). 

2. Allows string command inputs, which can be automatically parsed into actual primitive functions. 
   The objective here is, we try to query the frequently used targets more easily for you. 
   On a high level, parser works as the following:
    
    - If it recognizes a target name that occurrs in `instance.entries`, it automatically retrive the target.
    - If it recognizes a registered primitive function, it runs the function.
    - It also supports more general operators like ``>``, ``<=``, ``and``, ``or``, etc.
    - It resolves previously created attributes (``attr:attr_name``) and groups (``group:group_name``).

There is a basic wrapper class, ``errudite.build_blocks.PrimFunc``, to wrap all the functions up.
Errudite also has a list of functions to support computing instance attributes 
and/or build instance groups.
