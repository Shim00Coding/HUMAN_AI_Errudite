Pre-implemented prim functions
==============================

Errudite has a list of functions to support computing instance attributes and/or build instance groups. 
These functions are called ``primitive functions`` --- they are *attribute extractors* act on `targets` to extract 
fundamental instance metadata (e.g., `length(q)` returns the length of a question). 
These include:

* basic extractors like length, 
* general purpose linguistic features like token ``LEMMA``, ``POS`` tags, and entity (``ENT_TYPE``) annotations, 
* standard prediction performance metrics such as ``f1`` or ``accuracy``,
* between-target relations such as ``overlap(t1, t2)``, and 
* domain-specific attributes (e.g., for Machine Comprehension or VQA) such as ``question_type`` and ``answer_type``. 

``prim_funcs`` are composable through standard logical and numerical operators, serving as building blocks 
for more complex attributes.

Converters and targets
----------------------

*Get targets*: These targets contain text spans post-processed with state-of-the-art POS taggers, 
lemmatizers and NER models, along with metadata such as example id, or (in the answer case) 
the model that generated it. When additional metadata is not used, ``Target`` can be treated just as 
``Span`` in a function, or a piece of text with its linguistic features.

.. py:function:: question|context|groundtruth â†’ Target

Automatically query the target object (``Question`` and ``Answer`` in Visual Question Answering 
and Machine Comprehension, as well as ``Context`` in Machine comprehension). This can be easily extended to
any key that is in ``Instance.instance_entries``.
