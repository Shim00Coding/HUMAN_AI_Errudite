"We are going to gave are roller coaster drop height of 5 meters doing so has the perfect amount of potential energy and just enough potential energy at the bottom. We calculated the perfect amount of potential energy and kinetic energy to make the ride safe and fun at the same time. We also got the perfect amount of energy at the bottom of the coaster. So then it can make it up the 4 meter tall hill. We got rid of friction. The relationship between the drop and the initial drop is 1 meter. Are roller coaster is going to have a mass of 45kg to make the coaster perfectly safe and fun. We have made this coaster to be the most fun and safe roller coaster but also make it to the perfect amount between friction, potential energy and kinetic energy. so then it is perfectly safe and fun.

We have made this roller coaster  to be the safest and the most fun roller coaster so then it is fun and reliable and safe so then we can prevent the bad things that may happen during the roller coaster. Also then we can make the roller coaster fun reliable and extremely safe. We have done many test and problem solving to make this coaster the most fun and safe reliable roller coaster you can ride. we also made this roller coaster having many twist and turns to make it fun and safe. We are constantly adding to ideas and things we can changes to make this ride enjoyable. We also are adding many different things to make the ride scary but extremely fun and safe. We have calculated the perfect amount of potential energy and kinetic energy but with a little bit of friction. We have added many different twist and turns but are concerned that we may not have enough speed to get through the entire roller coaster.

We are constantly changing and modifying are roller coaster to be the safest it could possibly be so then we do not have problems and the people can enjoy the coaster",0,0,0,0
"My recommendation for the roller coaster would be that for the initial drop to be at the tallest it can to get a good momentum to keep your ride going. Following that your hill shouldn't be taller than your initial drop a the start because then the car wont be able to make it over. Lastly your mass shouldn't be huge but not small so right in the middle so the car can do the hills and all the stuff you want it to safely.

The greater amount of height there was more total energy released in the end, But with friction the total amount of energy would go down.
As the car goes down and comes to the stop PE goes all the way to 0 meanwhile KE goes up to a higher number.
The PE and KE depend on the height of the drop because the more the height is the more the PE will be a the top of the ride and the more the KE will be at the bottom of the ride. ",0,1,1,1
"I think the drop height of the roller coaster should be 5 meters tall. I want to have the drop height at 5 meters because height and Energy are directly related. In other words, when the drop height is greater the total energy will be greater. in our initial drop data when the drop was 5 meters the PE at the top was 2443 J compared to when the drop was at 2 meters the PE was 977 J. Also when the height is greater so is the connected energy at the bottom, at 5 meters the KE at the bottom was 2442 but when at 4 meters the KE at the bottom was 1954. The relationship between PE, KE, and TE is pretty clear,  with no friction the TE is always the same as the starting PE, and it doesn't change either at the end of the ride . The TE is always the amount of KE and PE when there's no friction. As the Car goes down the track the PE transforms its energy into KE. It always starts with all PE but at the bottom, the PE transforms all its energy into KE. When the height was 2 meters the PE was 977 and KE was 0 but at the Bottom, the KE was 977 and the PE was zero. The law of conservation of energy states that Energy can not be destroyed so The law of conservation of mass and Energy transformation work together. The reason the TE is always the same from the start to the finish is that no energy can be created. Even when a car has friction, the friction creates non-useful energy no energy was destroyed it just kind of went away into the surroundings. When it comes to the initial drop and hill drop height, the hill height has to always be smaller than the initial drop. If the hill height is the same size or bigger than the initial drop, then the initial drop won't have enough energy to get over the hill. When the hill and drop height were both at 5 meters the car didn't make it over the hill, yet when the hill height was 4 and the drop height was at 5 meters the car made it over the hill. Lastly when it comes to mass the greater the mass the greater the PE and KE. When at 50 kg the PE was 2448 and the KE was 2444, but when at 60 kg the PE was at 2937 and the KE was 2932. ",1,1,1,1
"First, I would recommend that the roller coaster car begins at an initial drop height of 5 meters off the ground. I believe that this is the best height for the initial drop because we learned that height and energy have a direct relationship so the greater the height of the initial drop, the greater the potential energy. For example, in my trials when I tested an initial drop height of 4 meters, I found that the PE at the top of the drop was 1955 joules and the KE at the bottom was 1954 joules. Then when I tested an initial drop height of 5 meters, I found that the PE at the top of the drop was 2443 joules and the KE at the bottom was 2442 joules. This shows that the greater the height of the initial drop, the greater the PE at the top of the drop, the KE at the bottom, and the TE. 

Also, I would recommend a hill height of 3.5 meters off the ground. I believe that this is the best hill height because, in my trials, I learned that the height of the hill must be less than the height of the initial drop in order for the roller coaster car to make it over the hill. In my trials, when I tested a hill height of 3.5 meters with an initial drop height of 5 meters, I found that the PE at the top of the hill was 1718 joules and the KE at the top of the hill was 729 joules. This data shows that the car has enough energy to make it up and over the hill and will make it to the end of the ride. This is the best hill height because it guarantees that the car will get over the hill safely while still being high enough to be exciting for the riders. 

Lastly, I believe that the mass of the roller coaster car should be 60 kg. I believe that this is the best mass because mass and energy also have a direct relationship so the more mass the car has the greater the PE, KE, and TE. In my trials, I tested a car mass of 50 and found the PE at the top of the drop was 2446 joules and the KE at the bottom was 2443 joules. Then when I tested a car mass of 60 kg, I found that the PE at the top of the drop was 2936 joules and the KE at the bottom was 2932 joules. 

All of these trials were tested on a frictionless track. However, since there is friction in the real world you would need to adjust the heights of the initial drop and hill to make sure the car would make it to the end of the ride with friction. In an environment with friction, some of the energy will be converted into thermal energy, slowing the car down. Since the Law of Conservation of Mass says that energy can't be created or destroyed, some of the PE and KE will be converted into thermal energy during the ride. This means that there will be less and less PE and KE as the ride goes on. But the TE will still remain the same throughout the ride. Since energy can't be created or destroyed, as the car goes down the tracks, energy is converted from PE to KE and back again but the total energy always stays the same.",1,1,1,1
"We started at a release height of 2 then we tested 3,4 and 5. each time we tested the roller coaster and the greater the height was greater the PE at the top.But the KE at the top was always 0.As the cart went down the hill the PE went down and the KE went up. The energy basically switched so if the PE at the top was 997 J the KE at the top was 0 J then the PE at the bottom was 0 J and the KE at the bottom was 977 J. The total energy is always all the energy added up and PE is energy before the cart goes down the hill and KE is energy after the hill. When we added the hill we learned that the hill always had to be smaller then the first drop or the cart would not make it over the hill.The weight of the cart has a lot to do with if the cart makes it to the finish or not it the cart was heavier it had more energy.",1,1,1,1
My recommendation is we start our roller coaster at the height of 5 because the higher the drop is the more total energy it has. For example when i tested the height of 5 the total energy was 2443. But when i tested the height of 3 the total energy was 1466. At the top of the initial drop the PE will have all the energy at the bottom the energy will have converted into KE but the total energy stays the same. That is because the Law of conservation of energy. The Law of conservation and energy states that energy can be created or destroyed but it can convert to other types of energy. So the total energy will stay the same but the energy with convert from PE to KE and the other way around.The energy will change when it is going down the drop the PE will be less but now it is going faster so KE will go up. Having a greater total energy will help the coaster car make it over the hill and loop. The hill height needs to be less than the height of the initial drop otherwise there will not be enough energy and it wont make it over the hill. So i recommend the hill height be 4. The mass of the car is also very important. The mass can also effect the total energy. For example when i tested the mass of 40 kg the total energy was 1956. But when i tested the mass of 60 the total energy was 2934. So having a higher mass will help the car go faster on the hill and around the loop making it more exiting. I recommend we use a mass of 55. All of this was tested in a friction less scenario. So when we add friction there is other types of energy that will need to be included thermal and sound energy. Thermal and sound energy wont be used so the total energy will go down. So we need to make sure we start with enough total energy to make it to the end.,1,1,1,1
"We should start the roller coaster at 5 meters for the initial drop. The initial drop should be 5 because that is the highest it can be for the roller coaster to be fun and safe. It should be the highest possible because as the law of conservation of energy states ""Energy cannot be created or destroyed."" This means that if we have a initial drop of 5 meters than the hill or loop that comes after that has to be less than 5 meters due to friction (heat, and sound energy.) When the initial drop was 5 meters there was more potential energy at the top of the drop  and more kinetic energy at the bottom so that means more total energy than the smaller drops. There for from my data I can say the greater the initial drop the greater the energy. 
The best decision for the height of the hill would be 4 meters and here's why. If we made the hill 4 meters people would have the most fun and still a very safe ride. Since the hill has to be shorter than the drop it should be 1 meter below 5 meters which is 4 meters so it has the most momentum. This means that it will go for the longest and the fastest because it has the most total energy. 
The mass of the cart should be the biggest possible again 60 kg because the bigger the mass the greater the energy. Also for the mass of the cart there will be more total energy which means more kinetic energy and potential energy if the mass is the greatest it can be. Of course this is all in a friction-less scenario but in the real world there will be friction. 
The best option for the Gonzales family would be 5 meters for the initial drop, 4 meters for the hill, and finally 60 kg for the mass of the cart. This will give their passengers the best most fun experience as well as a safe ride.

"We are starting our rollercoaster drop height at 5m.
The reason for this is that we think it will be most exciting for the riders because it was the highest option and also because you will gain the most speed from dropping from that height than you would on anything lower.
         The drop height relates to pe because pe would be greater if higher and same with ke and the bottom. The drop height relates to the kinetic energy at the bottom. After the cart went through the roller coaster at the bottom there would be a lot less potential energy and a lot of kinetic energy. This is because the object went through a ton of speed to get to the bottom. So like for our roller coaster since it drops from a high height it has lots of potential energy at the start and then has a bunch of kinetic energy at the bottom.
         Potential energy is the energy inside the object. Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object so all rollercoasters at the start have 0 kinetic energy because the cart is not moving but has a lot of potential energy. But once the cart goes through the rollercoaster it gets flip-flopped and kinetic energy becomes bigger number by a lot because the cart just was moving very fast and a lot. The total energy is kinetic energy and potential energy together and the total energy is usually around the same number as it was at the top of the drop and at the bottom.
       While the cart goes down the drop the potential starts to decrease very quickly and the kinetic energy number increases really quickly because the cart is moving and not just sitting still.
      The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So, for example, energy throughout a roller coaster is not getting destroyed it's either switching or the friction is turning into mechanical energy which turns into other forms of energy like heat+ thermal energy, and sound energy.
      My group has our initial drop higher a couple of meters higher than the hill because if the drop was the same or shorter it would be risky and unsafe. It would also be less likely for the cart to make it over the hill because it doesn't have enough energy/kinetic energy to get all the way up and down the hill.
      Whenever something has more mass it will have more energy. Yesterday when we were doing trials with different car masses my group noticed that the higher the mass was the more energy. The quicker the cart went through the rollercoaster. We also noticed that when the mass was lower it sometimes wouldn't make it up hills or get all the way through.

"My recommendation is to start with the height at 5 ft. I think this because if the hill is super high then that means we have a greater PE. if we have a greater PE then there will be more speed and more TE. After the initial drop we should add a hill that is 3 ft high. It works well with the 5 ft drop because it is smaller than the drop so it wont need the energy we dont have to get up the hill and make it over. Like the law states energy can not be created or destroyed it can only transform from one energy to another. So when there is PE at the top of the hill and the car goes down, it forms into KE. The total energy that we have at the top of the hill is the same through out the entire ride, it never changes. The mass of the car should be at least 50 kg because the more mass there is the more PE there is and we need a lot of energy to be able to get the coaster through the whole ride. i tested this stuff without friction obviously that's not possible in the real world. but in the real world the PE would be high but then when it got to the bottom and it formed into KE there would be less KE then there was PE at the initial drop.

"The drop height when changes the potential energy for a example when I had a release height of 5 meters beside 4 meters the 5 meters one had a height potential energy because the higher you are the more potential energy you have. The same is with kinetic energy at the top it is at zero and at the bottom it has the same amount as the potential energy had at the top. The changes to kinetic energy on the way down it is half way the have the same amount. When the energy is being transfer the energy cant be crates or destroy, but it an be transfer in to kinetic energy or potential energy. The relationship between drop height and hill heights.",1,1,1,0
"My recomendation is to start with a 5m so we have the greatest amount of PE at the top and the greatest KE at the bottom. We know the as height increases so does energy. We can see this in our initial drop trials when the PE is 782 J (in trial 1) the KE is also 782 J. When we increase the height of the hill the PE is 1173 J (in trial 2) and so is the KE. This proves that height of the drop relates to the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom, we can also tell from these trials that the PE, the KE, and the TE (total energy) have the same values in each trial. In the initial drop height trials also we know that PE changes to KE as the coaster car goes down the ramp. after the initial drop we will have 2 loops, then I hill with a height of 4.5m. The height of the hill is intentionaly slightly lower than the initial drop, this is because the car cannot go up a hill that is higher or the same height as the initial drop. We know this because of our Hills Data, in those trials the car only went up the hill when the hill height was lower than the drop height. At the End of the coaster there will be a bank that goes up 5.5 M. The goal of the ride is for the coaster car to just barely not make it up the hill and then fall back down and do the coaster again but this time backwards. At the end of the ride the car will end up back at the begining then come to a stop using a brake mechanism.",1,1,0,0
"My recommendation is we start out roller coaster's initial drop at the height of 5 meters. This way we can have the most energy possible. I know this is true because when I tested the initial drop height the first trial was 2 meters and there was only 977 J of energy. When I added height to the drop and made it 5 meters high there was 2443 J of energy. The height of the hill affects the potential energy at the top of the hill because as we know when the height is greater there will be more potential energy. This also means there will be more kinetic energy because according to the law conservation of energy can not be created nor destroyed but it can be transferred into other types of non-useable energy which is because of friction. Even with non-useable energy all the potential and kinetic energy will be added together and be the total energy at any point in the roller coaster. My next recommendation is we have a hill height of 3.5 meters. This would be the best selection because we can't have a hill higher or equal to the initial drop because it would need energy that it doesn't have and because of the law of conservation of energy we know we can't just create energy. When we ran a trial of 3.5 meters it had a potential energy of 1714 J at the top of the hill and 733 J of kinetic energy but the total energy was still enough to get over the hill and continue to keep going through the rest of the ride. The mass of the car should be 50 kg because mass and energy are a direct relationship, so when mass is higher energy is higher. We don't want the cart too heavy because of friction it wouldn't make it over some of the hills that a cart with less mass would. When we ran our trial with mass the 60 kg cart had the most energy but if we want a coaster that will have hills we should go a little lighter so 50 kg should be the best weight for the coaster. I hope you take my ideas into consideration and make the coaster the best it can be.",1,1,1,1
As we start our roller coaster to the height of 5 meters. The potential energy is always going to be more than the Kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop. when I measured the PE at the top of the initial the the PE was 1221 and the KE at the top of the drop was 3. The total energy of the drop between PE and KE was 1222. jewels  When the car was going down the drop PE went down in energy and KE went up in energy. When the PE went down the energy converted  into the KE. The drop height has more energy than the hill height because it has to be smaller than the initial drop to get to the rest of the roller coaster. when the roller car goes down the coaster the PE energy converted into the kinetic energy.,1,1,0,0
" The drop height when changed changes the PE for example when i had a release height of 5 meters beside 4 meters the 5 meter one had a higher PE because the higher you go up the better PE it has. 
The same is with KE At the top it is at zero and at the bottom it has the same amount as the PE had at the top. That when adding up for total energy you add both KE and PE together.  When the cart is going down the PE changes to KE on the way down when it is at half way the have the same amount. When the energy is being transfer the energy cant be crates or destroy but it can be transfused in to KE or PE. The relationship between drop height and hill height because the hill height is when it is at the very top and the drop height is when it is droping down.  That the lighter the mass is it will have a better PE because it weighs less. I tested this zero friction that is not real and cant happen

"Dear Mr and Mrs Gonzales, our design team has been working hard for your roller coaster and we have a design. imagine this a 450 ft Drop leading into a underground tunnel leading in to a loop where it leads into a corkscrew and a drop for the finish while going at a speed of 128 KMH. we found this design with a lot of trail and error but we found it.

"One recommendation I have for the roller coaster is to have the initial drop at 5 meters. This height is the best option because it would have the most potential energy to keep the ride going for as long as possible. When I had my initial drop height at 3 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 1466 Joules. When I increased the height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 2443 Joules. This is because the more height an object has, the more potential energy it has. At the bottom of the initial drop at 5 meters, the KE was 2442 Joules. My PE was 1 Joule. This is because at the bottom of the drop is when the car is moving the fastest, so the KE is the highest at that point. The PE is only 1 Joule because it is barely off the ground at that point. The total energy stayed at 2443 Joules. It is at that because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed, but it can convert between different types of energy. In a frictionless roller coaster, the energy is constantly changing from PE to KE depending on the height and motion of the car. 

Another recommendation I have for the roller coaster is to have the hill height lower than the initial drop height. If the hill height is the same as or greater than the initial drop height, then the car won't have enough total energy to continue the ride. When I had the initial drop height at 5 meters, and the hill height also at 5 meters, the car did not make it to the end of the ride. If we had the initial drop at 5 meters, then a good hill height would be 4.5 meters. At this height, it's short enough to continue on the ride, but it's tall enough to be a fun ride. The reason it would be more fun is that it would have more PE, and therefore would convert to more KE at the bottom of the hill and move faster. 

One last recommendation I have is to have the mass of the car somewhere between 50 and 60 kilograms. I recommend this because the more mass an object has, the more PE it has. That makes for a fun and safe ride because when it converts to KE, it will continue throughout the ride and move faster than a car with less mass would. For example, when I had a mass of 40 kilograms, the total energy was 1956 Joules. When I increased the mass to 50 kilograms, the total energy increased to 2934 Joules. These are all of the recommendations I have for the new roller coaster.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters this is because the higher the drop is the more PE. For example, if the drop height is 5 meters the PE is 2932 but if the drop is 2 meters 1173 that's why there will be more excitement the roller coaster will be more for the passengers. and for us the designers to make it and the higher the drop the more total energy there will be. Also the more KE there will be throughout the ride. and the relationship between KE and PE  and total energy. that when the cart is at the top of the drop there will be only PE because the cart is not moving., and KE is when the cart is going down the hill, and in a frictionless world they would just transfer back and forth from each other throughout the coaster. And when you are going down the drop the PE will all change into KE because the less height you have the less PE there will be. Also as we know because of the law of conservation of energy, ""Energy can not be created or destroyed"". So we know that the energy will have to change from one source to another when the coaster is going down the drop the PE will change into KE because the cart is moving. and then when you have to add a hill you have to make the hill shorter than the drop. because you need to have enough energy to make it. over the hill and not go backward the more mass there is on the roller coaster cart the more PE and KE there will be no matter the drop height if the drop height is 5 meters. and the cart mass is 60 Kg the PE will be, 2931 J of PE at the top but if you have a cart that is 40 Kg, then the PE will be. 1955 J. ",1,1,1,1
"For what your requesting, I recommend we have a drop height of 5 meters. I recommend this for a couple of a different reasons, firstly, at this height, we will get the maximum amount of potential energy. Essentially the higher the drop the more potential energy. potential energy shows how many jules of energy the kart and the people in it will have. In order to fully make it through the ride we need alot  ofkinetic energy, and in order to get this needed energy we need potential energy. Which we obtain by having a high drop height. My second recommendation is a kart mass of 51kg, mass and energy have direct relationship. This relationship is shown in each one of my trials, for example, when the mass was 51kg it had the most amount of potential energy. kinetic energy and total energy so in order to make the ride fun and safe this is the best way to do it",1,1,1,1
"I want the height of the initial drop to be 5. When the initial drop is at a higher height that means then that the potential energy is larger than when the initial drop is at a smaller height. In a model when the PE (potential energy) is higher the KE (kinetic energy) is smaller. When the KE is higher the PE is lower. In a frictionless world, our models have shown the total energy is the same as the potential energy in the beginning and the kinetic energy at the end. The law of conservation of energy is that no energy can be created or destroyed. That proves that when there is no friction the total energy never changes, it will always in that case add up to the same amount. The drop height has to be taller than the hill height. If it isn't the roller coaster car won't go over the hill. So for that reason, the hill height must be smaller than the initial drop height. Our group's hill height is 3 because our initial drop height is 5. When the mass is more the potential energy is more and that also means the kinetic energy is too when the car is in motion.",1,1,1,1
"I would recommend to make the initial drop 5 m because then the PE will be higher, meaning more PE at the beginning the same KE at the end. We tested 4 heights 5, 4, 3, and 2 meters. The drop height of 5 m had a PE of 2492 J at the initial drop. The height of 2 m had a PE of 997 J. From this information, the higher the release height the more PE at the initial drop at the top. Since there is no friction the KE will be what the PE is at the beginning because there is no thermal energy changing the energy into energy we can't use. PE is the energy ready to release and when the cart starts moving it slowly starts changing into KE which is energy when the cart is moving. If there is no KE then there is no velocity. When the cart is at the end it was 0 PE and whatever the PE was at the initial drop. The Law of Conversation of Energy says that energy cant be made or destroyed. Since there is no friction that law is true but if there was then it would turn into TE which is energy we can't use to make the cart move. When all the energy is TE then the cart is at a stop. For the hill height i would recommend a height that is lower than the initial height because it would have enough KE to get over. From out data we tested 5 m and 3 m. For the initial drop we decided on 5 m. First we tested 5 m for the hill height and it did not go over because the PE was the same as it was on top of the Hill. For the 3 m it went over because the PE on the initial drop was more than the PE on the top of the hill. The relationship between mass, PE, and KE is the more mass the more energy/KE/PE. We tested 3 masses 51 kg, 45 kg, and 40 kg. For 51 kg it was a PE of 2484 J and for the car mass of 40 kg it was 1956 J. As you can see the lower the mass the lower the PE and KE.

The initial drop of the roller coaster will be 5 m. The reasoning behind this choice is because the higher the drop the higher the Potential energy of cart which would in turn make more kinetic energy at the bottom of coaster. Why potential and kinetic energy are so important it makes not only the coaster fun but function. Potential energy can be defined as the energy stored in an object which transforms into kinetic energy when in motion. Total energy is the amount of energy stored or expelled in the object. The relationship of these being one cannot exist without the other as they are dependent on one another. As mentioned the potential energy converts into kinetic on its way down the coaster this is the motion of the object. Getting into why this is important in a roller coaster is because fun is speed that is important. In my data that i collected comparing a 2m drop to a 3m drop shows higher potential energy at the top of the coaster. 2m had a potential energy of 1173 joules and 3m had a drop of 1759 joules. Potential energy is the foundation of the fun and speed of a coaster and that's why the higher the better and why my team is having a 5m drop. Its good to mention that energy cannot be created nor destroyed which is the law of conservation of energy. Then how does potential turn into kinetic its because it transforms into the other.  The hill height is also important as its height is greatly dependent on the drops. as you cannot have a hill greater than the drop or it will not make it up as there will not be enough energy to make it up the hill. That's why i'm choosing a 3.5m hill to have a balance of speed and fun to mix the the actual ability of the coaster. comparing hill heights the cart actually had 590 more joules of potential energy when it was a 4m hill than a 5m one. Lastly the carts mass is important for a fun coaster just like the higher the drop the larger the potential energy the larger the mass the more potential energy and of course then in turn kinetic energy make it a faster and fun coaster.,1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because you can get the maximum amount of energy from that height, so you will have more speed and velocity. The higher the initial drop the more PE it has at the top of initial drop, but it doesn't affect the KE at top of initial drop and that stays at 0. If you have a higher initial drop the KE will increase the more meters you have on initial drop. The more PE you have, the less KE you have at the bottom of initial drop. Total energy is always the same as the PE at top of initial drop. For example, when PE at top of drop was 1759J, if you look across it shows that the total energy was also 1759J. Going down the initial drop, PE and KE transfer energy and once you get to the bottom of the drop most or all of the PE has transferred into KE. When the KE and PE dont add up to the same thing as total energy, it doesnt mean that the energy just dissappear, but rather it changed into a unuseful energy such as thermal. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. Between the drop height and hill height, the PE and KE are split at the top of the hill, but at the top of initial drop the PE is a thousand number, and KE is always 0 because it isnt moving. The more mass a car has, the more PE it has at top of initial drop and KE at bottom of drop. For example, 50kg at car mass, means it would be about 2446 at initial drop. If the car mass was 60 then the PE would be about 2936, which shows that the more mass a car has the more PE and KE it has. ",1,1,1,1
"The initial drop height should be 5m, this way we can get a lot of Potential Energy (PE) and Kinetic Energy (KE)  to get our ride going and can allow the cart to run on mechanical energy. Mechanical Energy is letting the ride go through the track without extra pushes on the track. In a frictionless world the PE and KE would be the same at the bottom of the drop, we saw this in our simulations. With a 5m drop our simulations showed that the PE was 2932 with a 60kg cart, we only tested the drop height we did not test a full ride or add anything else.  At the bottom of the drop the KE was the same as the PE at the top of the drop. As the cart goes down the drop the PE we had at the top of drop transfers into KE. PE transfers to KE when the cart is moving. In a frictionless world the Total Energy (TE) would stay the same throughout, but since we live in a world with friction some of the total energy would be lost due to friction. The law of Conservation of Energy says that energy is not created nor destroyed but can transfer between energy types, when we lose energy to friction the energy transfers to non useful energy, so when friction happens we have less PE & KE. I also recommend a 5m drop because then we can have a variety of hill heights, the hill height cannot be higher than the drop height. This is because we want there to be enough energy to get it over the hill our goal is to use mechanical energy to get the cart through the track, as said before this is not possible without extra pushe(s). The cart will also have more TE if it is heavier for our simulations we used 55kg and had made it up the hill sucessfully with energy still to use to get through the rest of the track.",0,0,0,0
"Our initial drop would have to be bigger than our hill height so the coaster could make it to the end. If the hill height is taller than the initial drop it would not make it to the end and it would be unsafe to our riders. From the initial drop our cart worked nicer when it had a higher car mass so a heavier cart will be beneficial. because of the PE being higher than the others, that means the car can go faster and keep the momentum so its safe and a blast to be on!. The PE of the car at the top of the initial drop was 2,445 J because it hadn't moved yet, and the PE at the bottom was 2,444 J because it had moved. then still had energy (momentum) to keep going to get to the end. The mass and energy data with the PE and KE were very similar and I think that will help our ride be fun and safe. with a smaller hill height the more momentum and the higher we can make the next hill because of all the PE to keep going. with all of this combined i think we will make a great coaster.",0,0,1,1
"The drop height of our car is going to be 5 meters tall. Because of the height of our drop there is going to be more potential energy at the top of the coaster and the same amount of Kinetic energy going down from the drop. The main reason it will have the same amount of energy is because the law conservation of mass says ""energy cannot be created nor destroyed"". This is true in our data also, when we had let it go from 5 meters its potential energy at the top of the drop was 2707 jewels of energy. And as it went down the drop and made it to the end the total energy was the same as it was at the top of the initial drop 2707 jewels. That changed when we added more or less mass to the car. We started by adding 5 more kilograms to our car to test if the total energy would go up as we added more mass, and it did exactly that. The 55 kilogram car had a total of 2682 jewels of potential energy. The same applied to the Kinetic energy of the coaster, the more mass you add to the car the more acceleration the car will have due to gravity adding more kinetic energy to the car.
The hill height was important to add some thought into as well, if our hill was as high as the initial drop it would not have been possible to even make it over the hill. This result occurred because of the total amount of energy was able to be used for the car. If the drop height was as tall the hill it would use all of its energy to make it up the hill but not have enough to get over it, that's why it had to be smaller than the initial drop.

"Hey, Mr. Gonzales I've created a roller coaster design for you. I can explain to you why I created it like this and my thought process of why I did it like this. The initial drop height will have to be higher than the hill. It can make it to where the car will finish the ride, if you don't the ride won't make it to the end and won't have any excitement or shock to it. One example i can give you is if you had a 5 meter initial drop and the hill is 10 meters high the car will not make it to the top of the hill. The higher the initial drop it will create more potential energy than if the drop was low. PE and KE can only be transformed into each other they can never be created or destroyed. This means that while the car is sitting at the initial drop it will have PE and when it makes it to the bottom of the drop it will have transformed into KE. This basically breaks down to PE = no movement, KE = movement. The total energy can always be known if you know what the PE is because they are the same thing. During the ride the energy will not be destroyed nor created it will only be converted into thermal and sound. The more mass the car carries the more energy it will have and it will conserve it. ",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. I think it should be 5 meters because that is the max amount that we can go to still be safe. At 5 meters the cart has the most potential energy at 2707 J, which means that it will have the most total energy on the ride at 2707 J. Another important factor that makes the drop perfect is the fact that the cart goes the fastest, which makes it the most entertaining. For hills, I think a 4-meter hill would be perfect. I think this because it would give the riders the most suspense when they are going up the hill. This is because they are producing tons of potential energy when they are about to go down a 4-meter hill, 1919 J to be exact. 1919 J of potential energy will turn into 1919 J of kinetic energy thus making the riders go very fast. Lastly, for the mass of the car I was thinking 55 kgs, I think this is the perfect mass because it is safe and produces a lot more potential energy at the top than a lighter car would. When I tested it in the simulation I found that the car had 2712 J of potential energy. To put that in perspective when I tested a car 10 kg lighter it only had 2190, making it not as fun for the riders. ",0,0,1,1
"The car would start at a drop height of 5 meters, the higher the drop height the more total energy (TE) the cart would have. For example when I had a drop height of 2 there was 1173J but with a drop height of 5 there was 2932J of energy. It would have only potential energy (PE) at the top of the initial drop and at the bottom it would have mostly Kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom. In a friction less environment, TE will never change while PE and KE will, but will always add up to TE. As the cart goes down the drop the PE will change into KE and halfway down it will be 50/50. PE will change into KE and the opposite, but they will never be less energy as, according to the law of conservation of energy, energy can't be created or destroyed. The drop height cannot be smaller than the hill height, otherwise the cart will not make it to the end of the coaster. For the connection to mass and energy, in short, more mass equals more energy. My idea for the coaster is to have an initial drop height of 5 meters and a hill height of 3 meters. The car mass will be 55 kg making it have a lot of energy to make it to the end of the ride.
",1,1,1,1
"     I want my car to start at 5 meters. This is because the higher the height the more PE the car has, and the more PE at the top of the hill the more KE at the bottom of the hill. 

     in a frictionless world, the PE will directly convert to KE, so to find the TE you add the PE to the KE and you get TE. When the car is going down a drop the PE turns into KE but the TE stays the same. 

     If your hill height is higher than the initial drop the car will not make it to the end, so you need a hill that has a height shorter than the initial drop.

     the mass of the car affects the PE because the PE=mass x height x acceleration due to gravity(9.8 m/s/s). for example, when I tested a 60kg car it had 2,933J of PE at the top of a 5m hill, but when I tested a 40kg car it only had 1,955J of PE at the top of the same hill.",1,1,1,0
"My first recommendation for this roller coaster would be to have an initial drop height of 5 meters. This would lead to more potential energy before it drops, and therefore more kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. I know this because when I tested a 4 meter drop, it had a potential energy of 2150 Joules at the top. Then when I tested a 5 meter drop, the potential energy at the top was 2688 Joules. Since the total energy is just the sum of the kinetic and potential energy, that means having a higher drop will give the coaster more total energy. The total energy in a roller coaster is constantly being passed between kinetic and potential energy. This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So having more potential energy at the top of the initial drop will allow the cart to move quickly and efficiently throughout the coaster. 
Another recommendation I have is to have a hill height of 4 meters. I think this would be best for the roller coaster because the hill needs to be shorter than the initial drop in order for the cart to make it over. For example, when we tested a hill height of 5 meters, which is the same as the initial drop, the cart did not make it over the hill. But when we tested a hill height of 4 meters, the cart made it over the hill with 1964 Joules of potential energy at the top. This means it has enough potential energy to keep moving after the hill. 
My final recommendation is to have a cart wight a mass of 50 KG. I think this would make the ride fun and exciting because my data shows that a 50 KG cart has  2438 Joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 2435 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom. This means that the energy almost entirely switched, which will make it easier for the cart to go over the hill. It also means that the cart will be moving fast and also safely. I think these recommendations would make the best safe and fun roller coaster. 
",1,1,0,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because according to the data when we increased the drop height the PE went up at the initial drop. For example we started at a drop height of 2 meters and the PE is 977 joules. When we increased the height of the drop to 3 meters the PE was 1466 joules. Also the KE at the bottom of the hill will be larger when you increase the drop height. This will help ensure that the coaster doesn't get stuck when it is going up a hill or through a loop.  

The hill height for my roller coaster design is 3 meters. This is because with the initial drop at 5 meters if we make the hill too high the cart won't make it up the hill. We can say this because our data proves that it won't make it up the hill height that is 5 meters tall. for example our data shows that when the hill is 3 meters the cart will make it up the hill with an initial drop height of 5 meters. When we move the hill height to 5 meters the cart doesn't make it up the hill. So we can infer that the hill has to be a smaller height than your initial drop. This is because when the energy transfers from PE to KE it won't be enough to get up the hill. The total energy is always the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop but the KE is different at the top of the hill. For example in our data when the hill height was 5m the PE at the top of the hill was 2449j but then when the cart gets to the top of the hill not all the KE transfers into PE. In our data the PE at the top of the hill is 980j and the KE at the top of the KE is 1463j. 

The mass of the car affects the energy when going through the roller coaster because the larger the mass the more energy the cart will have. So this means that if you want the roller coaster to go faster you should make the mass of the cart larger. For example in our data when the mass was 40kg the total energy was 1955j but when we had a mass of 60kg the total energy was 2933. ",1,1,1,1
"Some recommendations I would make to the Gonzales family is that I would make the drop height 5m. This is because I will need the loops and hills to be smaller than the initial drop height because the conservation law of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed. Also, the greater the initial drop the more PE there is at the top, and that energy will eventually transfer into KE at the bottom. For an example, when the initial drop was 3m, then the PE at the top was 1466J and the KE was 0J which equal 1466TE. Then at the bottom of the drop the PE was 1J and the KE was 1465J which has a TE of 1466J. This also shows that the PE and the KE combined will always equal the TE since the law of conservation of energy. At the start of the drop, the PE is greater than the KE but when it is at the end of the drop, the KE was greater than the PE. For example, when the initial drop height was 4m then the PE was 1955J and the KE was 0J. Then at the bottom the PE was 1J and the KE was 1954J. This clearly shows that the PE did not get destroyed but it was transferred into the KE throughout the drop. After the initial drop of 5m, I would make the hill height 4m and then the second hill height 3m. I would do this because you can't have a hill height that is taller than the initial drop height because of the conservation law of energy. When I did a hill height of 3m an initial drop height of 4m the roller coaster made it over. Then when I did an initial drop height of 4m and the hill also 4m, then the roller coaster wouldn't make it over. The more mass the more PE at the top of the drop and the more KE at the bottom of the drop. When the car mass was 40kg then the PE at the top was 1956J and then the KE was 1954J at the bottom. Then when the car mass was 50kg the PE at the top was 2445J and the KE at the bottom was 2444J. This shows that the more mass the car has the more PE and KE. This simulation is obviously done without friction but if there was friction it would effect the amount of PE and KE between the top of the drop and the bottom of the drop. Some of the energy because of friction would be turned into thermal and sound energy.",1,1,1,1
"The height of the drop should be 5 m. this will give the most pe to make it to the end of the ride. The pe of the 5 m drop was 2443J but when I decreased the height to 4 m the pe was 1955J, the pe, ke, and total energy will always be the same as long as the ride ends on the ground. When the drop height was 5m the 2443 and a ke of 2442 at the bottom of the hill, when the drop height was 3 m the pe was 1466 and the ke was 1465. The hill should be 3m tall, with the 5m drop the 3m hill the car will make it over the hill. When the hill height was 3m the car made it over the hill but when the height was increased to 5m the car could not make it over the hill. The mass of the car should be 60kg. The pe for a 60kg car will be 2933J but when I decreased the mass to 50kg the pe was only 2444. The greater the mass the more pe and ke the car will have. When the mass is 60kg the pe was 2933J and had a ke of 2932J of ke, but when the mass was 40kg the pe was 1955 and had a ke of 1955.",0,0,1,1
"My roller coaster design has an initial drop height of 5 meters. I chose this height because the higher your initial drop is, the more PE you will have. When you have more PE at the top, you will also have more KE at the bottom. I saw this in my data when I did a drop height of 2 meters I only had 977 J of PE at the top and 977 J of KE at the bottom. However, when I had a drop height of 5 meters I had 2443 J of PE at the top and 2443 J of KE at the bottom. From this data, we can see that as we increase our drop height we will also increase the energy of the roller coaster.
The relationship between PE, KE, and Total Energy is that PE and KE will have a cycle of trading joules back and forth forever in a frictionless environment. However, your total energy will never change from its original value. We can see this in our data as PE moves from 2443 J to just 1 joule throughout the roller coaster, and KE goes from 0 joules to 2442 j. We can also see that through this the total energy is never anything other than 2443 joules.
As we go down the drop we see the PE go from a large number of joules down to none. This is because the formula for finding PE includes height so the higher you are the more PE you have. Throughout the drop, KE increases from 0 j to the amount of j that you had of PE at the top of the drop. We can see this in our data when we see that in one of our trials, we started with 977 joules of PE and ended with 0 j. In this trial, we also started with 0 j of KE and throughout the drop, increased to 977 j at the bottom.
We have seen that our total energy can not change because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. We see in our trials that if we have a total energy of 977 j, even though the KE and PE transfer back and forth throughout the drop, the total energy will never change from 977 j.
From our trials, we have seen that our drop height must be higher than the hill height. From our data, we saw that we saw that any hill height that was lower than the drop could be used and the car would make it to the end. However, as soon as the hill is higher than the drop the car will not make it to the end. We see this in our data because as soon as we increased our hill height to be higher than the drop the car would not make it to the end.
The more mass that the car has the more PE and KE it will have. We see this in our data because the car mass of 40 kg only had 1956 j of PE and KE. When we had a car mass of 60 kg we had 2934 j of PE and KE.

"My team's roller coaster works so well mostly because of the initial drop height. The higher the initial drop height, the higher the PE at the top, meaning the KE at the bottom will be higher as well. This can be explained by the inverse relationship between KE and PE: when one goes down, the other goes up. TE in a frictionless environment is KE plus PE, but in a non-frictionless environment, TE accounts for all other types of energy and adds them all up.If the goal is to make the roller coaster as exciting as possible, it is essential to get the highest speed possible. Setting the initial drop height to the highest possible amount (5 meters in the simulation) will allow for the highest amount of KE at the bottom of each drop, which is the applied energy making the coaster move so fast. When adding a hill to the coaster, the hill height must be lower than the drop height. The coaster will be unable to get over the hill if the drop and hill heights are the same because it would be putting in the same amount of energy. It would get to the top of the hill but would not go over it. This is because energy can't be created or destroyed, and the PE at the top of the hill transforms into KE as the coaster goes down. In a frictionless environment, it will put in the exact same amount of energy going down the initial drop as it will going up the hill, meaning it is unable to get over the hill. As for the mass of the car, the higher the mass, the higher the PE at the top and KE at the bottom. This is because there is more of the object going down the hill, which increases energy and therefore speed. In conclusion, there are a few steps you need to follow in order to make the roller coaster ride as fun as possible. Set your initial drop height very high,  make sure your hill height is high but not as high as the initial drop, and ensure your car mass is high.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height is going to be 5 because that will give it enough energy to make it over the hill. The height of the drop relates to the potential energy at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom because the higher the drop height the more PE and KE. The PE at the top of the initial drop is the same as the total energy. The KE at the bottom is super close to the PE at the top of the hill. As the cart goes down the hill it gets less PE and gains more KE. The reason the PE at the top of the drop is the same as the total energy is because energy can not be created or destroyed because that is what the law of conservation of energy says. 
The drop height also has to be bigger then the hill height or else the cart won't have enough energy to make it over the hill. The larger the mass the slower the cart is so if you have to much mass it also won't make it over the hill. ",1,1,1,1
"The roller coaster should have a mass that is at least 60 kilograms) the initial drop at 5 meters, and a hill height of 4 meters to make it more fun. Potential energy and kinetic energy have an inverse relationship. One example of this from my data (initial drop height) is at the top of the initial drop (2 meters) the potential energy was  977 J. While at the bottom it was 0 J. The kinetic energy at the bottom was 977 J but while it was at the top it was zero. The potential energy transferred to kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy also pertains to when you're going down the initial drop, the energy transfers from potential energy (at the top of the initial drop) to kinetic energy (at the bottom of the initial drop) while going down. Which is relevant to the law of conservation of energy which states that energy will not be created or destroyed, just transferred. The height of the initial drop also plays into the energy because according to my data, while the release height was 2 meters the total energy was 977 J while at 5 meters the total energy was 2,442 J. The hill height has to be lower than the initial drop height because if it's not it will not be able to go over the hill. My evidence of this is in my data. When the hill height was the same as my initial drop height which is 5 meters high, the cart did not go over the hill it just kept going back and fourth. However, when the hill height was 3 meters high it went over the hill. The mass of the cart is also important for energy. According to my data when the car mass was 40 kilograms the total energy was 1,955. While when the mass was 60 kilograms, the total energy was 2,932. So one way to control energy is by adding more mass. If you have less mass, you can risk the cart not going fast enough to make it up the hill, and it likely wouldn't be fun or very safe. ",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters. This is because the more height there is, the more PE there will be at the top, and the more KE there will be at the bottom. For example, when we dropped the coaster from 2 meters, there was 977 joules of potential energy at the top, and 976 joules of KE at the bottom. When we dropped the car from 3 meters, there were 1466 joules of PE at the top and 1465 joules of KE at the bottom. This shows that the higher up the initial drop starts, the more total energy there will be. The amount of total energy didn't change at all, because energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can convert into a different kind of energy, but it can't be created or destroyed. Because PE is reliant on height, the PE went down as the car moved down. However, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, all that energy got converted into KE. As the PE went down, the KE went up. The total energy, however, didn't change at all. Because total energy is just all the different types of energy added up, in this case potential and kinetic, the total energy stayed the same this entire time. I think that the hill should be 3 meters. I think this because we want the hill to be tall so that it's exciting for whoever is riding the roller coaster, but we can't make the hill as tall as the initial drop. Whenever we made the hill as tall or higher than the initial drop, there wasn't enough energy for the car to make it to the end of the ride. If we make the hill smaller than the initial drop, then the car will have enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. I think that the mass of the car should be 50 kilograms. The more mass the car has, the more energy it will have. When we had a car with a mass of 40 kilograms, it had a total energy of 1958 joules. When we had a mass of 50 kilograms, the car had a total energy of 2449 joules. This shows that the more mass the car has, the more exciting the ride will be, since the energy it has will make the car go faster.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5 meters high. This is because when my drop height is taller than my hills and loops, the car will make it to the end of the ride. 
I noticed with my trials, the higher the height the more PE, KE and TE. For example, the PE at the top of a 2 meters drop height is 977 J while the PE at the top of a 4 meter drop is 1955 J. Next, the TE and PE at the top of the Initial drop will be the same. This is because PE is stored in an object. For example, the TE and PE at a 3 meter release height were both 1466 J. Next, while the car is moving down the drop, the PE will transform into KE. This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. For example, at a 4 m release height the PE was 1955 J of energy and while the car went down the drop the PE turned into KE so the KE was now 2442 J of energy. The 1 J of energy went into the air. Lastly, the more mass you have the Less PE, KE and TE you will have. This is because, the more mass you have the slower your car will go. For example, with a car mass of 60 kg the PE was 2444 J but with a 40 kg car the PE was 2446. These simulations were all tested with no friction. ",1,1,0,0
"My team and I have come up with a couple ideas for the roller coaster for you and your family's park. We want to start with an initial drop height of 5 m. That would create a PE of 2,443 J and a KE of 0 J at the initial drop, and a total energy of 2,443 J. Then the PE at the bottom of the initial drop will be around 1 J and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop will be 2,442 J, with a total energy of 2,443 J. We also did another test where the initial drop was 4 m, giving the PE at the top of the initial drop 1955 J, and a KE of 0 J at the top.  Then at the bottom of the initial drop, it would give a PE of 1 and a KE of 1954. This shows that if the height is higher then the total energy, the KE, and the PE, will be more. The total energy does not change throughout the ride even while the KE and the PE are changing. We decided to do 5 m since that is the highest height we could do.
We will then add a hill, with the height of around 4 m.  We would have done 5 m, but in my data when testing a hill height of 5 m and a initial drop height of 5 m, we found that the coaster couldn't make it over the hill. We found that this happens since there isn't enough KE to make it over the hill since the energy has to be split in between KE and PE, we had to make it 4 m. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that Energy can't be created or destroyed only changed, and that is also the reason we can't make the hill height and the initial drop the same. Keep in mind that the tests we are doing are in a frictionless environment, so this data wouldn't be the same as if it was in the real world.  
We were also planning on making the carts 60 kg, since that would give the ride more energy at the at the initial drop and at the bottom of the drop. In a test I did where the mass of the car was 60 kg, the total energy was 2936 J. Then in a different test where the mass was 50 kg and the mass was 2446 J. This shows that when the mass increases the energy increases.",1,1,1,1
"I would recommend to not make the first loop or hill taller than the initial drop. Because if you make the first hill or first loop taller than the initial drop then the roller coaster will roll back down the hill or loop and it will not make it over. If the hill or loop is smaller though, then it will make it over the hill or loop. 

When the car is at the top of the initial drop then it has the most PE it will ever have. But if the car is halfway, then the KE and PE are about the same because of the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. 

PE and KE flip flop energy as the car is going down the hill. Because energy cannot be created or destroyed. The more mass the car has the harder it is going to be going up a hill. Because the more mass something has the heavier it is going to be because it weights more so it will not have enough speed to make it over the loop or hill because of gravity.  

If the car is lighter the easier it is going to be to get it to go up the hill or loop. Because it is lighter so it will not slow down as easy as the heavier one will. As the Initial drop height goes up, the more PE it will have. For instance at initial drop height: 2 the PE is 977, but at 3 it is 1466. And as it goes up the more PE it will have.",1,1,0,0
"I think that the height of the initial drop should be 5 meters. This is the best height because it will create the most potential energy at the top of the drop and the most kinetic energy at the bottom. For example, when the initial drop height was 3 m, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 1466 J. However, when the initial drop height was 5 m, the potential energy was 2443 J at the top of the initial drop. A similar thing happens to the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop. When the release height was 3 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J, while when the release height was 5 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J. Having an initial drop height of 5 m will make this ride more fun and exciting.
At the top of the drop, the potential energy is equal to the total energy because the kinetic energy is at 0 J. This is because the car is not moving- kinetic energy comes from motion. As the car travels down the drop, it gains more kinetic energy because it is picking up speed and loses potential energy because it doesn't have as much height. This is not because energy is being created or destroyed- in fact, the Law of Conservation of Energy says this is impossible. The energies are transferring among themselves as the car moves through the ride. 
I think the best hill height would be 3 meters. If the height of the hill is equal to or greater than the height of the initial drop, the car will not continue to the end of the ride. For example, when the height of the hill is equal to the height of the initial drop, which in this case is 5 m, the car did not reach the end. However, when the hill height was 3 m, it did reach the end. Putting the hill height at 3 m will make it so the car will not stop before it is supposed to but will also be fun and fast. 
The best mass of the car would be 50 kg. For example, when the mass of the car is 50 kg, the potential energy is 2444 J at the top of the initial drop and 2436 J of kinetic energy at the bottom. When the car mass is 40 kg, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is 1955 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom is 1949 J. The car will move faster and therefore be more exciting with 50 kg than 40 kg, but not be too heavy to not be able to make it over hills. 
All of these trials were conducted without friction, but I know that there would be friction in the real world. With friction, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop would not be as close to the potential energy at the top of the drop because some of the energy would turn into a non-mechanical kind of energy like thermal energy.

"The drop height is five meters. My group decided on this specific height because we think going the highest even though it could be risky, we figured out with a specific amount of mass,add a lop instead of the hill first. It will work because the penitential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) would not be an issue. Lets break it down. At the start, PE was 2443, and going through the roller coaster, the end it was at the end it was 1. Going down that drastically, shows how the mass is light, and how it would make the roller coaster fast. Meanwhile with are second choice being four, it starts at 1955 and ends at 1835, making it slow, and boring.   The five works better to for the lop, because when the lop goes down we can make the hill pretty high because of the power of it going down. We decided on 3.5 for the hill because its a little more then half way, and the mass going down so much will make the energy go down. That will eventually after the coaster hits the hill. it will slow down because we also have a straight line at the end eventually making it stop. I hoped this helped your understanding of roller coasters!",0,0,1,1
"Dear. Gonzales Family, the drop is going to be 5m because the total energy is substantial to the height of the hill.  When the car mass is 50 the PE top of the initial drop (5m) would be 1958 J and KE bottom of Drop would be 1955 J. The total energy would be 1958 which would be good because the car would not need friction to get over the kill which would make it very fun for customers. No energy is created or destroyed so what happens to the mass at the bottom? It transfers to thermal energy. The drop height and hill height of the track is related because the drop is a measure of energy and the hill is a measure of PE. KE and PE are the amount of energy in the sim, which means the mass depends on KE and PE. This our idea Gonzales family.",0,0,1,0
"The drop height for the roller coaster will be 5 meters. This is because the taller the initial drop height the more PE there will be. Having more PE means we will also have more total energy and KE. This is because energy cant be created or destroyed according to the Law of Conservation of Energy. For example  when the initial height was 3 meters the PE at the top was 1466J with the KE being 0J. Then at the bottom the KE was 1456J and PE was 1. Next, we tried 4 meters and got 1955J of PE and 0J of KE at the top, then at the bottom 1954J of KE and 1J PE. Finally we did 5 meters and got a PE of 2443J at the initial drop and KE with 1J PE at the bottom and 2442J of KE. This shows like that I said, the more height there is the more energy there will be, making it so the roller coaster can make it until the end.

For the hill height we decided on 3 meters. This is because the hill height has to be less then the initial drop. It needs to be less then the initial drop because if its to high there wont be enough energy to get over the hill, as energy cant be created. When we tested 5.01 meters the cart was not able to go over. At the top of the hill the PE was 2448J, which is greater than the energy given at five meters, making it so the cart coldnot go over the hill. We decided to go with 3 meters because at the top of the hill the PE was 1471J and KE was 975J with a total of 2446J, making the cart able to go over the hill. 

We also learned that the greater the cars mass the more PE and KE it would have. For example when we used 40kg for weight the PE was 1955J, at the initial drop, and the 1951J of KE at the bottom of the drop. On the other hand a 60kg cart had 2933J of PE at the initial drop, 2927J of KE at the bottom and the total energy being 2933J.",1,1,1,1
"For our teams roller coaster design we will design it to be exciting but also make it to the end of the ride without stopping. First of all, to make sure the car will make it to the end of the coaster we will make the initial drop height be 5 meters high. We will make it 5 meters high because we have learned that the higher the drop the more PE the car will have to make it to the end. For example, we tried many trials including drop heights of 2,3,4, and 5 and noticed that as the height of the drop increased the PE also increased. To be specific, when the height was 4 meters, the PE was 1,955 J and when the height was 5 meters the PE was 2,443 J which also increased the total energy. As the PE increased the KE also increased at the bottom of the initial drop and the more KE energy it has then the more energy it will have to make it to the end of the coaster. As the PE at the top of the initial drop decreased, the KE at the top of the initial drop increased which helped me notice how they had an indirect relationship. When we set the release height at 4 meters, the total energy was 1,955 J but when we increased the release height to 5 meters the total energy was 2,443 J. As PE went down the drop it decreased and changed into KE which increased the KE energy as it went down the hill. According to the Law of conservation of energy, no mass can be created or destroyed. For example, when the PE was 2,443 J and the KE was 0 J the total was still 2,443 J because there was no friction changing the energy into other mechanical forms and no energy could be destroyed or created. When the drop height was greater than the hill height, the car had enough PE to make it over the hill. On the other hand, when the drop height was the same or less than the hill height, the car could not make it over the hill because there was not enough PE. When the mass of the car increased then the PE also increased and the KE increased as well. For instance, when the car mass was 50 kg the PE and KE were both 2,443 J. When the car mass was 60 kg the PE and KE were both 2,932 J. This data also shows how car mass, KE, and PE all have a direct relationship. This information helped us decide that we want the initial drop height to be higher than the hill height and we want the mass of the car to be 60 kg because that's what produced the most energy. ",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of 5 worked best for me because it created the most PE and was the easiest to get over the hills. For example when my drop height was at 5, my PE was 1955 at the start of the drop. But when my release height was only at 2 the PE at the top of initial drop was only 782 and was harder to get up hills and make it to the end successfully. During the start of the cart the PE was 1955 and when it began to go down the hill the PE amount would switch. The KE amount, and once the cart got to the top of the hill the KE would switch to the PE. By the end of the ride the KE was at 0 and my PE was at 1955 the total energy at the end of the ride was also 1955. Because there no longer was any KE so the total amount was the amount of PE. When the cart was going through energy transformation the cart would not stop if energy transformation continuted to happen and would never actually stop. For the cart to stop the PE needed to stop and there needed to be no KE. For me and my group we decided that the best way we could transfer energy and store more was to make small hills that the cart could speed through and end with the most amount of KE. For example our smallest hill was 2 m  and our KE at the top of the hill was 1462, but when our highest hill that was 5 m the KE at the top of the hill was only 602.  When we had more car mass our PE was higher. For example, our biggest car mass was 60 and our PE ended as 2936, and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2930.",1,1,1,1
"The height of the roller coaster's initial drop should be 5 meters. This is because in order for the coaster car to make it to the end of the ride the initial drop needs to be greater than the height of the hill. The initial drop height needs to be greater than the hill height because there needs to be enough PE to transfer into KE in order for the roller coaster car to make it over the hill. In a trial, when the height of the initial drop was 5m and the hill height was 5m the car's PE at the top of the initial drop was 2,446 J and the KE was 0 J. The PE and KE were the same at the bottom because the car didn't make it over the hill. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed. In one of my trials for the initial drop, the coaster car started with 2,443 Joules of PE and 0 Joules of KE at the top of the initial drop. At the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 1 Joule and the KE was 2,442 Joules. If the energy can't be created or destroyed, then where did this energy come from? Well, it was transferred between KE and PE. There was no KE at the top of the drop because the car was not in motion yet. The car had only PE because it was at rest and all of the energy was stored. At the bottom, however, the energy changed to KE because the car was in motion and the PE has fewer joules because there was no more stored energy. To confirm that PE and KE transfer the energy between each other in another one of my trials the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1,955 J and KE 0 J. Then at the bottom the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1,554. The mass of the car affected the PE and KE because when the car's mass was 60 kg the PE, KE, and TE were greater. But when the car's mass was less then the car had less PE, KE, and total energy. ",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my rollercoaster will be 5 meters. This will give more Potential energy, and at the bottom, more Kinetic energy. This will make the car go further, and faster giving more  flexibility for the hill height.Speaking of hill height, I would say should be about 3 meters. This is a height that we can be sure the car will go through. this is because there will be enouch for the car to go past the hill no matter the friction. There will be enough kinetic energy for the car to go through the hill at this height.I would also reccoment more mass. Why? Well, the more mass, the more total energy for the car to use to accelerate. With this design, the car will start at the top with a lot of potential energy. When it starts to move, and go down the hill, the potential energy will be converted to kinetic energy. The car will then use this Kinetic energy to move up the hill. Then it will use the potential energy from going up the hill to go back down, and convert the potential energy to kinetic energy. The total energy will never change during this time. This is because the law of conservation of mas states that energy can't be created, or destroyed. It can become diferent energy like thermal energy, but it will never go away.",1,1,1,1
"    The drop height should be 5 meters with the hills and loops being slightly smaller than the drop. 
This is because the higher the drop is the more potential energy there will be to carry the car over the hills. During my experiments, I saw that when the height was set to 5 meters the Potential energy was 2443j but when I dropped the height to 4 meters the Potential energy went down to 1955j. This drop was very important to note because if there isn't enough potential energy the roller coaster won't be able to go over the hills and loops effectively.

In my following experiments, we kept the height the same(5 meters) and the hill height the same(3 meters) and increased the mass of the car. I found that when we used a 60kg cart versus a 50kg cart the 60kg cart had more potential, kinetic and total energy than the 50kg cart.

The law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. When I added friction to my carts I noticed that my potential and kinetic energy was no longer the same. This was because the friction changed into an external source of energy that can no longer be used. 

In conclusion, the drop height should be 5 meters so the cart will be able to go over the hills and loop more efficiently. The weight of the cart should be 60kg because it will have more energy, and the hill should be smaller than the original drop.

"when making your roller coaster you should make the drop height 5 meters, the hill height 3 meters, and the mass of the cart 50kg

first you should make the drop 5 meters because of the relationship between height and energy. the relationship between height and energy is directer so when one goes up the other goes up to. by making it so the height is high you make it so the energy is high too. for example when getting data at the top of the drop with the height of 2 meter the PE was at 977 joules of energy at the top, with the KE of 0 joules. the drop with the height of 5 meters at the top had a PE of 2442 joules of energy at the top. with the KE of 0 joules. at the bottom its the same the energy just converts to the opposite. or into other types of energy like sound and or heat. in the simulation i used had no friction so there was no heat or sound energy. that's why when  the cart got to the bottom the ke was 977 joules for the first trial and 2442 joules for the second. both with a pe of 0 joules. on earth that's not possible so that's why you want to make the hill smaller then the drop so that with the friction it can still go over the hill. the TE can never change it will always stay the same because of the law of conservation of energy. so starting with a higher amount of energy means you'll end with that energy. 

by making the cart 50kg the cart will make it so you can have more energy, then if you have a lower amount of mass this will make it so there is less energy. but if you have more mass then there is more friction so it might not ride as smooth. for example in the simulation i use i did three trials the cart mass was 40, 50, and 60kg. the trial with 40kg had 1955 joules of TE. the 50kg had 2443. the 60kg had 2932 joules. by making it so its 50kg you get the benefit of more energy but don't have to worrier as much on the friction.

"The initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters tall. This is because the higher the initial drop the more PE. For example when I tested the initial drop of 5 meters I got a PE (potential energy). Of 2443 Joules compared to my test of 4 meters which had a PE that decreased to 1955 Joules. At the bottom of the 5 meters the KE was 2442 Joules, and the drop height of 4 had a KE of 1954 Joules. But the total energy will always stay the same as energy can be created or destroyed. The PE and KE change and transfer to one another but never is destroyed. As it goes down the drop the PE will convert in to KE.  In addition, if you where to add a hill would need to be lower than the initial drop. Because if the hill is the same or taller than the initial drop the car wouldn't have the energy to make it up the hill. The height of my hill was 4 meters because it was the highest I could have before it wouldn't make it over the hill because of the height. For example with a hill height of 4 meters I got a PE of 1963 Joules. It got all the way to the end. My second test failed as I tested the hill height of 5 meters and it wasn't able to make it up and over the hill. The PE was always less than the initial drop so it can make it over the hill. The KE was less too but still the PE and KE would inter change with each other. All of these tests were done in a friction less environment. I know that in the real world there is friction to account for. Friction will take some energy away from the car as it moves. where the energy goes is in thermal and sound energy among multiple of different types of energy.   ",1,1,0,0
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because when you have a high drop height it means that the rest of your roller coaster could be longer because there will be more energy so that you can have a longer track. For example, when I tested the drop height to 2 meters there was only a PE of 977 joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters there was 2443 joules, the PE increased by 1466 joules. When the coaster goes down the hill it will lose almost all of it PE, so the next hill or loop that you decide to make would have to have a slightly smaller height. Other wise it won't make it with the amount of KE it has left. Another thing that would have to be thought about is the weight, because with it being too heavy would mean that it might not make it up the next hill. One thing that I recommend is having a 47-53 kg car so it will have enough weight but not too much.

Also I had done all of my testing with 0 friction, so I know that most of this info would not actually work with friction but with no friction this info is correct.",1,1,1,0
"The drop height for my coaster destine is 250 meters. This is because the more height you have you will have a larger PE on the top and a higher KE at the bottom. One example is with a drop height of 2.50 meters the PE at the top was 1334 joules and at the bottom of the drop the KE was at 1333 joules. When compared to a drop height of 5 meters the PE joules  at the top was 2668 and the KE at the bottom was 2666 joules. Having a curtain height of a hill it important, in order to make it up a hill the hill has to be smaller than the initial drop but if it is taller or the same height it will not make it over. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, this states that energy can't be created or destroyed. At the initial drop  of 5 meters the PE is at 2668 joules but at the bottom of the drop the PE is at 0. That is because the energy will be transformed into KE on the way down because at the to of the drop KE joules is at 0 but at the bottom KE is at 2666 joules. The total energy doesn't change tho it will always stay at the same number it is just put into didn't a different energy, for example PE it put into KE or thermal energy. ",1,1,0,0
"Our team's roller coaster will have a starting height of 4 metres.

This is because the amount of Potential Energy (PE) is related to height, and it's a direct relationship. A direct relationship states that if one variable increases, for example, height, then the other variable also increases, for example, PE.

For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 metres, the PE was 1955 Joules (J). Upon changing the drop height to 5 metres, the PE changed to 2443 J, a massive step up.

To explain energy on a roller coaster, we have to look at the Law of Conservation of Energy (LCE). LCE explains that energy cannot be created nor destroyed. If a hill is taller than your initial drop, your cart will not make it to the top and never will as it will not gain or lose any more energy. To have a cart pass a hill or loop, the height must be smaller than the initial drop. 

When we had an initial drop height of 5 metres and a hill height of 5 metres, the cart failed to pass the hill, but every other trial succeeded. The initial PE was 2449 J, and the Kinetic Energy (KE) before the cart went backwards was 12 J. Looking back on the final KE, we can notice it simply doesn't have enough to continue moving up the hill, it can only fall back down. Lowering the hill height, even by a fourth of a metre, would allow the cart to successfully pass the hill and move on.

When a cart moves down the hill, the PE is converted to KE. This, as a result, will build speed. Note that the energy being converted is not adding energy, the Total Energy (TE) is the same. At the very top, PE is TE, and KE is always 0. At the bottom of the drop, KE is, instead, TE, and PE is 0.

Remember that the hill height cannot be as high or higher than the initial drop or the cart will not make it over the hill. It's crucial to know that since it could ruin the entire ride if the cart can't make it over a section.",1,1,0,0
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 250 meters. This is because the higher your drop is, the more energy it has, therefor, it will be able to make it to the end with ease. When the initial drop was 2.5 meters, the potential energy was 1334 joules at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1334. Then, when the drop was 5 meters, the potential energy was 2668 at the top and the kinetic energy was 2666 at the bottom. Having the initial drop be higher than any of the hills or loops is best because then the roller coaster will have enough energy to make it to the end. As you can see from the data above, when the height is the same the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom are equal. This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed. So, when you are about half way down the hill, potential and kinetic energy are about equal, and then when you get to the bottom, all of the energy would have converted from potential to kinetic energy. Although, in the real world (simulation excludes this part for accurate data), some of the energy will change into other forms like heat, sound, etc. so the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom wouldn't be equal. In addition, when the mass increases, potential, kinetic, and total energy will all increase.",1,1,1,1
"There are certain factors to consider, the mass of the cart and the height of the drop and hill. The cart should be dropped from the highest height with a smaller hill. The higher the drop the more potential energy it will have, if the height of the hill was the same as the drop it would not have enough energy to make it up the hill. For example, In our data the initial drop had been at 5 and in the first trial and the hill at 2. It made it to the end and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill had been 1173 J. At the last trial the hill had been the same height as the drop, it only had 7 J of kinetic energy and did not make it to the end. Therefore the hill needs to be a bit less than the height of the drop, so it is still able to keep going if needed making it a more exciting ride. Mass of the cart is also very important. Depending on the ride the mass of the cart should be somewhere in the middle rather than lower or higher. In our first trial the mass was at 40 kg and the potential energy was at 1956 J, this gave it around the same kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop due to transferring energies. and at 60 kg it had 2934 J at the top of the initial drop. In the middle, 50 kg would be perfect for a fun ride if loops and hills are the final goal design. It will have just enough energy to make it to the end of the ride. These are the current suggestions I have provided for the roller coaster that is desired.",1,1,0,0
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because  if the height Is higher it will give the cart more energy and momentum. For example when I tested the drop height of 5 meter the PE was  2443  Joules. When I decreased the drop height to 4 meters the PE decreased to 1955 Joules. The energy when the initial drop was smaller went down a lot. But when the initial drop was higher the energy went up. PE and TE may change depending on the  KE. KE and TE are usually not the same because the TE is PE + KE = TE. 
The change in PE and KE when going down the hill is when you first go down the hill it is a higher PE. But as soon as go down the hill the PE gets lower and the KE goes down one from one from the PE. The drop height is  taller then the hill height. So the drop height will give more energy to go over hills. Mass is how much something weighs. PE and KE are both types of energy, mass gives the KE and PE energy to go faster or slower. ",1,1,1,1
"for starters, it has a 400 ft intial drop that is inverted. then goes into a 300 ft loop and and 200 ft hill after that then going under the ground, and then stoping on a flat serface. The cart will make it to the end because the amount of energey from the intial drop will be enough to go though the loops and, hill even if friction changing enrgey to thermal energey. So the Pe at the top will tranfer to enough ke at the bottom to make it though the loop and hills. the pe and the ke will switch off energy to have it so the total of both always equal the same. And sence force can not be made or destoyed the cart will make it to the end. and the drop hight is 400 ft compared to the loop that is 300 ft. that is a differants of 100ft giving it plenty of energy to make it over. Also in are data the more mass you have the more total energy you have. but it also will take more energrey to get up the hills. like in the experament the car the was 60 kg had more energy then the 50kg car and the 40kg car. but also the 50kg car had more energy then the 40kg car. This is without frction. In the real world the out come would be bifferent because, some of you energy would be turned into thermal energy.",1,0,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster is 250 meters. This is because height and potential energy are directly related. That means as we increased the height of our simulation, the amount of potential energy at the top of the drop increased. Which overall affected the amount of total energy within the car. So at the bottom of the drop, there was enough kinetic energy to get the car over our hill. The total energy of the car was whatever the potential energy was at the top of the drop. (This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy) As we went down the drop in our simulation, the potential energy decreased and the kinetic energy increased. Which means they are inversely related. The higher the car is off the ground, the more potential energy it has. One thing we noticed as a group was that the drop height had to be greater than the hill height. That is because the car didn't have enough potential energy to get itself over that hill when they were the same height. Overall, the mass affected the amount of total energy we had. For example, when we simulated having the car mass be our independent variable, the total energy of the car increased as we increased the mass. 
THIS WAS DONE IN A FRICTIONLESS SIMULATION",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because when you have a higher drop height the PE is larger making the car go faster, so it is able to go up hills and go through loops. For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 1955 but when I increased the drop to 5 meters the PE increased meaning it was able to go up our 4 meter hill and go through loops.

When I tested the roller coaster the PE and the KE were almost always stayed the same. This was because the track was friction less. And some of the changes that happened when the cart went down the initial drop were the PE and the KE almost canceled out another. The car was moving the PE went down and the KE got larger. For example if the PE was 100 the KE would be zero. As the  car goes down the hill the PE starts to decrease while the KE increases and the by the end of the ride the KE would be 100 and the KE will go down to 0.

When you have greater mass it will always effect the PE and KE. For example, my data shows higher the mass higher the energy. 50kg car mass it equal to 2448J PE, 40kg is equal to 1958J PE meaning more mass more energy.

"The drop heigh of my roller coaster design is 4 meters. This is because the higher the drop height the more energy that is being generated, so that would mean it would be able to last the whole ride and have a greater. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE increased at 1466 Joules. The relationship of PE, KE, and TE is that TE is the combined amount of (PE + KE). This amount may decrease by the end of the ride due to the mechanical energy that absorbs some of the TE. PE and KE change as they go down the drop. The energy at the initial drop is always higher than at the bottom. For example, when releasing the cart from 4 meters, at the top of the initial drop  was 883 PE and 0 KE, but it changed. I know this because at the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 0 and KE was 650.  This allows me to talk about energy transformation and Law of Conversation of Energy. Odviously, the TE energy decreased because some of it converted to mechanical energy and became useless energy. Thats why TE energy is smaller at the bottom of rides rather than at top. The relationship between drop height and hill height has to make sure hill height is never greater than initial drop height. I know this because when I had a drop height of 4 and hill height of 3.5, the cart made it through the whole ride. But when I had a drop height of 4 and hill height of 5, the cart didn't make it through the ride. Lastly, the relationship between mass, PE and KE! If the cart has a greater mass, the greater the PE and KE will be. I know this because when I had a car mass of 50, the total energy was 2447, but when I had a car mass of 60, the TE was 2936.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height for my roller coaster is going to be 5 meters. This is because we want the most PE at the top of the drop as well as the most KE at the bottom of the drop. The more energy, the faster and more exciting the roller coaster will be. For example height and PE have a direct relationship I know this becasue when I did my test and tested 2 meters the PE was 880 joules but when I tested 5 meters, the car had 2199 joules of PE. So when the the height is increased so does the energy and we want the maximum energy so we also want the maximum height. PE is the kind of energy it will have at the top of any part of the ride when the car is completely still but still has more movement left to come. KE is movement energy so we will  have KE in our model once the car has started to go down the hill and it will keep increasing until it stops moving at the bottom of the hill. The TE will always be the same as whatever you start with no matter if you start will PE or KE becasue the energy has no where to go so the TE will remain the same. For example in my data at the 2 meter drop the PE at the beginning was 880 and it stayed that way all the way through the ride. As you go down the drop the PE drops and then the KE rises because you being move. Another example is when I had a 5 meter drop the PE at the top was 2199 but at the bottom is was zero, and at the top the KE was zero but at the bottom the PE was zero. Also the Law of Conservation of energy states that energy cannot being created or detroyed. So when the PE goes from a high number to zero the energy doesnt go away instead it is just transferred into a new type of energy. Most often being transferred into KE this is why the TE will stay the becasue the energy does go away and KE doesnt just appear. They just transfer back and forth until they go to something else like thermal energy. Also when you are deciding you hill height you need to make sure that it isnt greater than your drop height or the car will not make it up. You keep the same amount of energy the whole time so as long as you make the hill smaller the car will have enough energy to get up that hill. Another example of this is when I had a 5 meter initial drop and a 5 meter hill the car could not make it over the hill because it did not have enough energy from the top of the initial drop. Next the relationship between mass and energy is also direct the more mass you have the more energy you will have too. When I had a car mass of 40kg the PE at the top of the drop was only 1958 but when we bumped up the mass to 60kgs the PE went up to 2936. This shows that if you increase one the other also increases. I understand that in the real world we do have friction but for my data and explanations it was taken place in a frictionless world. ",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the relationship between height and energy is direct, and when the height of the drop increases the TE increases. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2m, the PE at the top was 977 Joules at the top. When I increased the height to 5m, the PE increased to 2443 Joules. Both PE and TE increase when the height increased. As for KE, when I test the drop height of 2m, the KE at the bottom was 977 Joules. When I increased the height to 5m, the KE increased to 2442 Joules. Next, I noticed that PE+KE=TE. For instance, when my height was set to 2m, the TE was 977, the KE at the bottom was 977, but the PE was 0. When my height was set to 5m, the TE was 2443, meaning the KE at the bottom was 2442, and the PE is 1. This shows that the more PE and KE, the more TE you have. I will be making the height of my hill 3m. One reason I am doing this is because as the car goes down the roller coaster, the KE increases but the PE decreases. This is an example of an inverse relationship. At the top of the drop, all the energy is PE, but as the car moves down the KE rises just as much as the PE falls. For example, when my height was 5m for the drop, the PE started as 2443, and the KE as 0. When my car went down the drop, the PE lowered to 0, but the KE rose to 2443. This data also shows us how energy is transformed into PE to KE as the roller coaster goes along the track, but no energy is ever lost. When the TE remained as 2443 during the trial for 5m drop, this proves the Law of Conservation of Energy. No energy is lost or created, it is just transferred into PE or KE. Another reason I will set my hill height as 3m is so the car will have enough energy to make it over the hill. As I tested relationships between height of the drop and hill, the only trial that successfully made it to the end was when the hill height was lower than the drop height. For instance when the drop height was 3.5m, the car only made it to the end when the hill height was 2m. When the hill was 5m or 3.5m, the car did not make it to the end. So that is why my drop height will be 5m and my hill height will be 3m- since the hill height is less than my drop height. Lastly I want my mass of the car to be pretty high because the more mass you have, the more TE you have. For instance, when I had 40kg as my mass, my PE at the top was 1955. When I increased the mass to 60kg, my PE increased to 2933. I want to make sure I have enough energy to make it to the end and increasing mass will increase the energy, including both KE at the bottom and PE at the top.
",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the cart will need to have enough potential energy to make it over the hill. For example when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE didnt have enough joules to make it over our hill. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE was much greater and had enough energy to make it over the hill. If my drop is 5 meters high then that means that my hill needs to be anywhere less of 5 meters or the potential energy wont have enough joules to make it up the entire hill. In my model to stop the cart we have one hill at the end that doesnt go back down and so the cart goes up and loses all its potential energy and comes to a stop. If the drop of my coaster is higher it will have more potential energy at the top and more kinetic energy at the bottom. Potential energy is how much potential the car has/will have. The only time you can have potential energy is when the cart is above surface level. kinetic energy is when the potential energy is transferred as it goes down the hill so that the kinetic energy can push it back up or bring it to a slow stop. One dropping down the hill the kinetic energy shifts perfectly in line with the potential energy. If you are half way down the hill both energies will be even, total energy is always all the energies added up. For example if you start with 1,000 joules of potential energy and have 0 kinetic energy, you will have a total of 1,000 joules of energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can no be destroyed. This means that it must be transferred to another energy source just like kinetic energy to potential energy. Drop height will always start with 0 kinetic energy and will have to be higher than the hill height to be able to make it over. once you make it to the hill you will have partial kinetic energy and partial potential energy because it wont be high enough to equal the total energy.
The mass of your cart will effect your coasters potential energy and kinetic energy because the cart is much harder to transfer as it is a much heavier object.",1,1,1,1
"My recommendation for the Gonzales family is to have the drop height at 5 meters. This is because when I tested the drop height at 5 meters, the PE was 2209 Joules at the top, and KE was 2209 Joules at the bottom. But when I put the drop height at 2 meters the PE was only 883 Joules at the top and the KE was only 883 Joules at the bottom. 5 meters would be my best recommendation because more PE makes it faster and more KE will keep it safe.      In my model the higher the KE and PE the higher the TE. This is because KE and PE equal TE. So I recommend a higher amount of PE and KE so there is more energy and velocity. One way to get high TE is to have a car with a big mass. I recommend a 60 kg car because in my simulation the PE was 2933 at the top and the KE was 1924 at the bottom. But with the 40 kg car the PE was 1955 and the KE was 1951. Once again we want high PE and KE so a 60 kg car would be best.

     In order to keep the coaster going the whole time we're going to need to have a hill height of around 3.5 meters. The hill needs to be smaller than the initial drop in order to make it to the very end of the ride. When I tried a 5 meter hill height the car didn't make it to the end because there wasn't enough energy. When the height was 3.5 meters the car made it to the end. As the car goes down the drop the PE will go down and the KE will go up. At the end of the drop the PE should start rising again in order to get up and down the hill. Another component of making it down the hill is conservation of energy. Energy can change into non-mechanical types of energy. This means it is still present but it is useless for our roller coaster. If there is no friction the energy shouldn't change into a different type. The coaster will continue going if PE and KE never transfer into different types of energy.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster will start off being 5m high. 5 meters high will then have more energy, which will make the roller coaster go faster. For example, when the height was 4m high, the PE was 1955J. When I increased the height to 5m, the PE was 2553J. This happens because the higher up the roller coaster is, the more PE it will have because PE is how high something is. After the roller coaster reached the bottom of the drop, there was no PE because there was no height, and it all translated into KE. It translated into KE because there is KE when there is motion. So while the roller coaster is moving, the PE would be converting into KE, because there is more motion while the height is going down. Due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, mass cannot be created nor destroyed, making the total energy stay the same throughout the whole ride.
 
Moving on, I feel the drop height should be 4m. I decided on this because we still want the ride to be fun, so having a bigger hill would be more enjoyable. But if we make the hill too high, then the roller coaster wouldn't be able to make it over the hill. For example, when I did 4m, it made it over the hill fine, but when I did 5m, it didn't make it over. This is because it didn't have enough KE. 

Lastly, I would like to make the mass of the car 60kg. I decided on this because the more mass the car has, the more energy will be given. For example, when the car mass was 50kg, the PE was 1958J. But when I increased the mass to 60kg, the PE was 2349J. By doing this, the car will have more energy making it able to go faster in the long run. Yes, it will accelerate slower, but it would be faster. To end this, I hope you take my proposal for my first design for the roller coaster.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the higher the height the the more energy there with be. There will be more potential energy at the of the drop and more kinetic energy at the bottom of it. When I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the potential energy was 2445 joules. But when I increased the drop height to 5 meters the the potential energy was 2446 joules. Iv'e noticed that the potential and kinetic energy always added up to the total energy without friction. Something else I noticed was that going down the drop, the potential energy was changing into kinetic energy. I also learned that due to the law of conservation of energy that energy can't be created or destroyed. So when it seemed that some of the energy was disappearing. It turned out that energy was just getting converted into thermal/heat energy and no energy had been destroyed. My drop height was 5 meters and my hill height was 3.5 meters. So even with friction acting on my roller coaster. It was still able to get over the hill. Something else I learned is that the more mass my roller coaster has, the more energy it will also have. Meaning that if a 50 kg roller coaster at the top of the drop and hill will have more potential energy. And at the bottom of the drop and hill it will have more kinetic energy when compared to a roller coaster with only 40 kg.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coster is going to be 5 meters. This is because the more height the car has the more potential energy. For example, when my drop height was 2 meters the potential energy was 977 joules. When I increased the drop height to 3 meters the potential energy increased 489 joules. When the car got to the bottom of the drop, the kinetic energy was greater the more height it had at the begining. 
Kinetic energy and Potential energy add up to the total amount of energy. The conservation of energy law states that energy cannot be created or distroyed. At the top of drop the potential energy has the total amount of energy, but as the car goes down the drop it tranfers into kinetic energy. Once it is at the very bottom, potential energy has 0 joules and kinetic energy has the total amount because kinetic energy is involved with velocity.
Potential energy is based on three things, one of them is height. The greater the height the more potential energy. When the car starts 3 meters tall the potenial energy is 1466 joules. If you put a hill that is 4 meters tall then there will simply not be enough to get over the hill. The energy can't be created or distroyed, the car only has enough to get up 3 meters. Also the more mass the car has the more energy because potential energy is height x mass x gravity. The greater the mass the greater the energy.
My roller coster will have an initial drop of 5 meters and will have a hill right after that is only 2 meters high. The car will make if over easily expecially because the mass is 50 kg. After the hill the car will be able to go farther will hills, loops, ect. So it is really fin and fast but it is still safe.
",1,1,1,1
"One recommendation I want to make to the Gonzales family is to have the initial drop height be 5 meters, so that the coaster car will have enough energy to safely make it through the entire ride. This is because height and energy have a direct relationship, meaning when one goes up the other does too. My data shows this because when the drop height was 5 m, the PE was 2,688 J, but when I decreased the initial drop height to 4 meters, the PE decreased to 2,150 J. You want to make sure you have enough energy for the whole ride, so you want to have a big TE. TE is found when you add the PE and KE together, meaning you want to have a good amount of each when you can. One way to create a bit more energy is to increase the mass of the coaster car, because like height and energy, mass and energy also have a direct relationship. This is seen in my data because when my car mass was 60 kg, the TE was 2,934 J, but when I decreased the mass of the car to 50 kg, the TE was 2,445 J. One thing to be aware of is how PE and KE can convert from one to the other as the car is moving. PE will be greater when there is more height and KE will be greater when there is more motion. The energy can convert, or transform, from one energy type to another because according to the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy cannot be created nor destroyed, giving it no other option than to transform into a different type of energy. The last recommendation I have is to make the hill height less than the initial drop height so the car is able to safely make it up the hill. The reason this is needed is because if the heights of the hill and the initial drop are equal, the car won't have enough energy to make it up the hill, because energy can't be created. This is shown in my data because when I had a hill height of 4 m, the car had 529 J of KE, but when I decreased the hill height to 3 m, the car had 1068 J of KE. This shows that the greater the hill height, the less energy the car will have, meaning we want a low enough hill height for the energy to make it all the way up the hill safely. Those are my recommendations for what we should do with the roller coaster.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters. This is because the greater the height, the greater the energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 1173 at the top of the drop. When I made the drop height 5 meters, the PE was 2932. That means that the PE was increased when the height increased. Similarly, at the bottom of a drop height of 2 meters, the KE was 1173. Then, at the bottom of a drop height of 5 meters, the KE was 2932. This also shows the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy. The PE and KE always add up to be the total energy. For example, when the drop was 3 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 1762, and the KE was 0. When added, they equal 1762, which is the total energy. The PE and KE always balance each other out. They never don't equal the total energy (when there is no friction). As the car goes down the drop, the PE transforms into KE. When the PE goes down, the KE goes up. The total energy will always stay the same (when there is no friction) throughout the trial because energy cannot be created or destroyed. 

When I added a hill, it always had to be lower than the drop height or else the car couldn't make it to the end. For example, the drop height was 5 meters and the hill was 3 meters, the car made it over the hill with ease. Then, when I changed the hill height to 5 meters, with still a drop height of 5 meters, the car couldn't make it over the hill. 

The mass and the energy has a direct relationship. When the mass goes up, the PE goes up. When the mass goes down, the KE goes down. This means that when there is a greater mass, there is a greater energy. ",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because when the drop height is higher the total energy is higher. For example, when i tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 0 joules. when i increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at 1 joule. The hill height of my roller coaster is 2 meters. This is because when the hill height was lower the car made it to the end but when the hill height was higher the car didn't make it to the end. For example, when i tested the hill height of 2 the PE at the top of the hill was 964. When i increased the hill height to 4 the PE at the top of the hill increased at 1734 joules. The car mass for my roller coaster design is 60kg. This is because when the mass is higher the total energy is higher. For example, when i tested the car mass at 40kg, the PE was only 1578 joules. When i increased the mass to 60kg the PE increased at 2368 joules. So that is why it is better to have a higher drop height and car mass but it is better to have a lower hill height so your car makes it to the end. ",1,1,1,1
"My recommendation is to have the roller coaster weigh 60kg and for the initial drop to be 5m. The ride will start at the top of the hill, where the coaster has the most potential energy. As the coaster goes down the hill, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion. The coaster gains speed and momentum, and as it approaches the bottom of the hill, it reaches its maximum kinetic energy. As the coaster begins to slow down, it climbs the next hill, and the potential energy increases. This process continues as the coaster goes through the various hills, drops, and loops of the ride. The relation between the initial drop height and hill height in the roller coaster is determined by the speed of the roller coaster and the laws of physics. ",0,0,0,0
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters. This is because the energy is dependent on the height. The more height, the more energy. In my Initial Drop Data, I noticed that when I increased the height, the energy increased with it. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 3 meters, the PE increased to 1319 Joules. The height of the drop also relates to KE at the bottom, assuming there is no friction, the KE at the bottom will be the same as the PE at the top. Back when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules at the drop, and the KE was 883 Joules at the bottom of the drop. 
Adding on to this, PE, KE, and TE are all related. For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, PE was 1759 Joules, the KE was 1759 Joules at the bottom, and the TE was 1759 Joules. This shows that PE and KE always add up to equal the total energy.
Furthermore, PE and KE going down the drop won't be equal, but they do always add up to the total energy. For example, if the total energy was 200, and the PE was 150 going down the drop, and KE was 50. We can conclude from the previous sentence that PE and KE change going down the drop, but always add up to equal the total energy. 
The change in the KE, and PE, along with TE, all relate the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that energy can't be created or destroyed. What I saw in my data, was the total energy never went up or down. This is because energy wasn't created during the trial, but it also wasn't destroyed. 
This is all related to the drop height and hill height. If you have a drop height of 4 meters, and a hill height of 5 meters, it is most likely that your car will not make it up the hill height. This is because the initial drop height's stored energy, is all the energy there is. If you have a hill height that supports more energy than there is, then there won't be enough energy to make it up the hill. 
Lastly, mass, PE, and KE are all related. The more mass there is, the more stored energy, and KE there will be. For example, in my trial where my mass was 40 kg, the PE was 1565 Joules, and my KE was 1565 Joules too. But in my trial where my mass was 50 kg, the PE was 1956 Joules, and my KE was 1956 Joules too. This shows that if the mass is greater, then the PE, and KE are also greater. This is an example of a direct relationship between mass, PE, and KE.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because the height was the largest it could be and the energy gave it enough momentum to go all the way down the hill. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1624 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE 
increased at 2166 Joules. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So when the energy at the top for PE is high and the PE at the bottom is low I know that the PE turned into both thermal energy and KE. The same thing happens to KE. At the top the KE is low and at the bottom the KE is high because the PE has turned into KE. Mass also effects PE and KE. The more mass something has the slower it will go down the hill. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is that both PE and KE add up to create total energy. The height of the drop also effects PE and KE. At the top, the PE has the largest number but at the bottom it has a smaller number. Also at the top, the KE has a smaller number but at the bottom it has a larger number.

"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because we want more energy and for it to make it over the hills and around the loops. The more height you have the more energy. For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1173 joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased and was 1995 joules. The relationship between KE and PE and total energy is that in a fiction-less world, the PE and the top of the initial drop is the total energy, and KE and PE switch off. For example, when the drop height was 3 the PE was 1173 and the total energy was also 1173. When the cart goes down the drop KE and PE swap. For example, if the cart is exactly halfway down the hill and the PE was 100 and Ke was 0 at the top. Then the KE and PE would both be 50 There would always be the same amount of PE and total energy in a frictionless world because energy can not be created or destroyed. If the drop height is 5 meters the hill height would have to be smaller than 5 meters. The more mass you have the more KE and PE you have and more total energy.",1,1,1,1
"Our chosen initial drop height is 5 meters because when your initial drop is taller, you have more total energy, which will help you get to the end in a more fun, safe way.  I know that because when my simulation was at 4 meters, the PE at the top was 1564 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 1563 Joules.  When I simulated a 5 meter drop, the PE at the top was 1955 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 1954 Joules.  Showing that when the height goes up, so does the total energy.  
With more total energy, our cars will have more PE at the beginning and more KE at the end.  For example, in a frictionless simulation, when the total energy was 1173 J, the start PE was 1173 J and the start KE was 0 J.  Within the drop, those roles were reversed and the end PE was 1 J and the end KE was 1172 J.  
In one of my simulations, the total energy was 782 J, but my PE was 0 J and my KE was 781 J.  This is an example of how energy may seem like it goes away, but due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, it can't and it just transitions into a different kind of energy.  
We wanted to have the highest possible drop height because, to make it all the way, your hills and loops have to be smaller.  For example, when our drop and hill height were 5 meters, our car didn't make it to the end and just kept going up and down the hill.  
Also, when the car has more mass, the energy goes up as well.  This was proven in our simulation when the mass was 50 kg and the TE was 2445 J and the mass was 60 kg and the TE was 2934 J.  ",0,1,1,1
"I think the should use the highest intial drop of 5 meters and 4 meters for the hill height. I also think they should use a higher number for the car mass like 60. The 5 meter start height will give the car enough energy to not only finish but also do it faster than it would if it were shorter, the car mass being 60 will also ad more velosity and make the ride more exciting. the hill height being 4 meters will also add more excitment while also being shorter than the intial drop allowing the car to make it the whole ride. In all of the expriiments we did the drop height increasing increased the potential energy and the same with the car mass.",1,1,1,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5m tall. This is because 5m was the initial drop with the most PE. When I tested the 5m initial drop the PE was 1955 joules. When i decreased the height to 4m the PE deceased to 1564 joules. This initial drop height will optimum for most energy right at the start of the roller coaster drop. 
The hill height will be 4m tall. The hill height will be 4m tall because that was the tallest height with the roller coaster making it over. When I tested the 4m height the cart at the top had 1569 joules of PE and 389 joules of KE. When I decreased the height to 3m then the PE at the top of the hill was 1179 joules. The KE for the 3m hill was 776 at the top. Since the 5m hill didn't work for the cart, the 4m hill will be the choice. The 4m hill had the least amount of energy loss in out friction less environment. 
The weight of the cart will be 60kg because that was the cart with the most PE at the top of the hill. When I decreased the weight of the cart to 50kg the PE was only 2448 joules while the PE for 60kg was 2937 joules. The PE for a cart of 40kg was only 1958 which was the least amount of joules in our tests. Having the cart be heavier will allow it to go further on the roller coaster, if it was friction less. 
This was all done in a friction less environment. If there was friction the hill height would have to be less than half the size of out initial drop, but that's no fun. This design would be the most fun design because it has a large drop and hill which will allow the people to feel the drop for longer. I conclude that these design choices would make the best roller coaster for your families theme park.

"The drop height of my roller coaster will be 4 meters. This drop height will allow the roller coaster to have lots of potential energy at the top of the drop, which will help it keep going throughout the whole ride. This will happen because the potential energy turns into kinetic energy, which makes the car move. For example, when I tested a drop height of 4 meters in the simulation, the car had 1876 Joules of potential energy at the top, which means it also had 1876 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom. If we compare this to a drop height of 2, which had 938 Joules of potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom, we can see that the drop height of 4 meters had much more energy. This higher drop height will also allow the car to accelerate for a longer time, making it go faster.
The relationship between potential, kinetic, and total energy is that the potential and kinetic energy always add up to the total energy at any point throughout the ride. This means that there will always be the same amount of total energy, and so the ride will never stop unless it gets stopped by something else. 
At the top of the hill, the car will only have potential energy because it is not moving. As the car moves down the hill, the potential energy starts turning into kinetic energy, at the same rate. If kinetic energy increases by 10 Joules, then potential energy decreases by 10 Joules. At the bottom of the hill, the car will have no height, and therefore it will have no potential energy, just kinetic energy. This also means that when the car is at the very middle (half the height of the original drop), it will have the same amount of kinetic and potential energy. 
The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. The energy doesn't disappear, it just changes form. For example, at the top of the initial drop, there were 938 Joules of potential energy and 0 Joules of kinetic energy. At the bottom of the hill, there will 938 Joules of kinetic energy and 0 Joules of potential energy. This shows that the energy changed from potential to kinetic, but isn't completely gone.
My hill height will be 3 meters. This is because the hill height needs to be lower than the initial drop height. If the hill height was larger than the initial drop height, the car would not have enough energy to get up the hill. when I tested a drop height of 3 meters and a hill height of 4 meters, the car did not make it up the hill and just fell back down instead. With a drop height of 4 meters and a hill height of 3 meters, the drop will be larger than the hill, but the hill will still be big enough to be fun and exciting. 
The relationship between mass, kinetic energy, and potential energy is that objects with a greater mass have more potential energy, and therefore have more kinetic energy as the energy is converted. My car's mass is going to be 50 kg because then the car will have enough energy to make it through the ride but it won't have too much mass.

"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. This is because we want are cart to go fast so we put the height up 5 meters.  For example when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2165 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 2697 Joules of PE. Then the KE was from 2165 Joules with 4 meters. Then when I changed to 5 meters the KE was 2697 Joules. When it is friction less almost always the PE will go into KE when it is at the bottom of the ride. For example the PE at the top of the drop was 2697Joules, then the KE was 2697 Joules at the bottom of the drop.

When halfway from the drop to the ground the PE and the KE are the same that is because when we are down the hill the PE goes down, but the KE goes up. When the Law of conservation of energy can get created or destroyed that is why the PE goes into KE when the cart is moving down.

The relationship between drop height and hill height, the drop height should always be more than hill height. For example if the drop  height is 5 and the hill height is 5 then the KE will not have any energy to get up the hill. So that is why the drop height should be more than the hill height.

The relationship between mass, Pe and KE is very intrestiong. For example if you have 50 kg on the cart. Then the KE on the top of the initial drop is 2453 and the KE at the bottom of the drop is 2453.
If I add more mass on the cart then the PE and KE will go up.",1,1,0,0
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3 meters. This is because our loops, hills, and turns need enough speed from the initial drop to get to the end of the coaster. The height of the drop relates to the PE because if you make the height higher than the PE is going to be higher but if it's lower then the PE is going to be lower. The height relates to the KE because at the bottom of the initial drop, since the height was 3 meters the KE is going to be a lot larger than the PE.

For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1446 joules. When i increased the height to 4, it was 1955 joules, the PE increase at 549 joules.

As the cart was going down the initial drop the PE was going lower and the KE was going higher. But when we added friction the PE at the top while it was moving was less without friction, and vise versa for KE. The energy transformation changed when the height of the roller coaster changed. If the cart was in the middle of the initial drop and the bottom of the initial drop then the energy would transfer from more PE to more KE. 
 
Some similarities I observed with the initial drop height and hill height was the same thing but with smaller numbers. That's because if the hill is taller than the initial drop then the cart wouldn't make it over the hill it would just go back and keep on going back and forth because of the friction.

The relationship between PE, KE, and mass was the higher the mass and the drop height made the PE or KE change in the amount of energy they had.",1,1,0,1
"The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters. The potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height above the zero position. For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 3 meters, the potential energy increased to 1759 Joules. Additionally, on my roller coaster design when the height of the drop was 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules, and kinetic energy was 0 Joules, but when the roller coaster went down the track potential and kinetic switched. The potential energy was 1 and kinetic energy was 1172, so potential energy changed into kinetic energy, this is because potential energy changes into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy convert into potential energy, and then it repeats in a cycle.
",1,1,0,0
"The initial drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters, because the higher the drop the more PE there is to get it through the rest of the roller coaster. For example when the initial drop height was 3 meters the PE at the top was 1173 joules and 1173 joules of KE at the bottom. However when the drop height was 5 meters the PE at the top was 1957 joules at the top and 1957 joules of KE at the bottom. The PE at the top and the KE at the bottom are the same because of the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed only transform from one form into another. The PE transferred into KE as the car was going down the hill. So the total energy will not change even as the car is moving. 
Also if the initial drop height is higher than it can make it over the hill. If the hill is the same height or higher than the initial drop then the car won't be able to go over because it won't have enough kinetic energy. For example in testing, when the hill height was 3 meters high and the initial drop was 5 meters, the car had 778 joules of KE at the top of the hill and made it over. But when the hill and initial drop were both 5 meters the car's KE at the top of the hill was 0 so it did not have enough energy to make it over. 
However these tests were done without friction so some of the energy would transfer into thermal energy, so you would need a lower hill height and more momentum from the initial drop. Nonetheless the total energy stays the same and the same rules apply, such as the hill height needing to be lower than the initial drop height. ",1,1,1,0
"The drop height of my roller coaster is 5.00 meters. This is because the higher the drop, the more potential energy you will have. The more potential energy you have, the more total energy you have. Having a decent amount of total energy will make it easier for the cart to make it over the hill, and loop. Although, you don't want the drop height to be too large, or else the ride won't be safe. 
For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.00 meters, the potential energy was 876 joules. When I increased the drop height to 3.00 meters, the potential energy increased to 1319 joules.
I am going to put my hill height lower than my drop height. The reason I am doing this is because after the initial drop, there is only enough energy made to make it over a hill either the same size, or smaller than the initial drop. This way, the cart will still be able to make it over the hill, and it will also be a fun roller coaster.

"The drop of my roller coaster is 5m. This relates to PE and KE. For example When the hight was 5m the carts PE at the top was 1952 and KE was 0. But when the cart was at the bottom of the hill the PE was 0 and the KE was 1952. Energy cant be created or destroyed so knowing that the total energy has to be 1952 and the KE+PE have to be 1952. When the cart goes down the hill the PE goes down and the KE goes up. No energy is gained or lost. Drop hight and hill hight arre simaler because the hill needs the drop. An example is if the KE is the same as the hills PE the cart will not make it up. If they hills PE is smaller that the hills KE the cart will make it up the hill. Mass efects the PE because the more mass there is the more PE there is. IN my data the mass was 40kg and the PE at the top of the drop was 1952, but when the mass was 60kg the PE was 2929. This also aplies to KE.",0,0,1,1
"The initial drop should be around 50-100 yards(3x50 or 100) high and the car should be around 40 KG. And I say this because if you have a high drop you'll have a lot more PE(potential energy) than if you add a lower drop. And on top of this, a higher drop means you can have the coaster go longer or higher. On top of this, you'll have more KE(kinetic energy) thus buying you more times to add hills for the car/coaster to go up. This means you can A) charge more. B) get more people to ride your coaster. C) have more creative freedom.
And even more so you could add a loop if wanted. With all the extra PE to convert into KE you'll have more TE(total energy) to have the car spend on things like hills, loops, twists, and ECT.
Although you may want to consider how many people you're gonna have per car. Seeing as the weight will also heavily impact how the coaster performs. And on top of that, how much TE, KE, and PE the coaster will hold/have. Less of each will mean it won't perform as well depending on what you're planning on doing. For example, let us say like a lot of cramped hills. Sure that's possibly a good idea for a low-drop and light car. But it wouldn't be too well for a big car. Now if they were tall hills and/or loops with a high drop. Yeah, that'll work better. Point is, You'll wanna think about how high it'll be and how heavy the car will be.

Seeing as PE/KE and mass are DIRECTLY(one goes up the other goes up) related to each other.  And I say this because of the fact that you can't create nor destroy energy. Now all this testing was done in a frictionless simulation. But it does show that you need to have something of a balance when it comes to energy shift and energy transformation.
Before I go I also want to say a few things. When going down a drop you have a lot of PE at the top. But as you go down a drop your PE converts into 'useless energy'(which doesn't affect us in the simulations I ran. But it will later) and KE. Now the KE converts BACK into PE as it goes UP as hill/drop. So you do really have to think about how you want your drops to go.",1,1,0,0
"To have a fun and exciting rollercoaster, a recommendation I would make for the Gonzales family is to have the height of the initial drop be 5 meters, the height of the hill should be 2 meters, and the car mass should be 60 kg. It would be best for the initial drop to be 5 meters because the more height you have, the more TE there will be. At the top of the initial drop, the more height means there will be more PE and then as the car is moving, the PE will change into KE and other types of energy which will make the car go faster. For example, when I tested the initial drop height of 2 M the amount of PE was 887 J, but when I tested the drop height of 5 M the amount of PE at the top of the initial drop was 2,179 J. The PE and KE added up together always equal the TE because the PE changes into KE during the rollercoaster. At the top of the initial drop the KE is always 0 because KE is energy in motion and at the top of the initial drop the car is not in motion. However, as the car starts moving, the PE (energy at rest) changes into KE since the car is in motion. The TE will always be the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop unless there is friction. The Law of Conservation of Energy tells us that energy is neither created nor destroyed, the same energy just changes into different types of energy like KE, thermal energy, and more. The hill height should be 2 meters because the hill height will have to be smaller than the initial drop height. This is because energy can't be created nor destroyed and if the hill height is greater than the initial drop height, energy can't be created so the car won't be able to make it over the hill. When I tested the hill height at 5 meters and the initial drop height also at 5 meters, the car wasn't able to make it over the hill because energy can't be created nor destroyed. When I tested the hill height at 2 meters and the initial drop height at 5 meters, there was more TE than when the hill height was greater. I think the mass should be 60 kg because the more mass the car has, the more PE, KE, and TE there will be. When the mass of the car was 40 kg the TE was 1,565 Joules, but when the car mass was 60 kg the TE was 2,348 Joules. That is why I think the height of the initial drop should be 5 meters, the height of the hill should be 2 meters, and the car mass should be 60 kg.",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales Family, 

   The roller coaster my team has designed provides a safe yet thrilling ride. It has an initial drop of 5 meters. Hills reaching 4.75 m and thrilling speeds. We believe that this ride will provide satisfaction to its riders while getting them safely to the end of the ride. Here's a look at the data we've collected, and our progress so far in our designs. 

   The first step in our design process is the initial drop. We needed to find the best height to provide the greatest amount of energy to be able to insure a fast ride. Through our data we found that five meters provided a total energy of 2443 J and the lowest at our lowest tested height of 3.75 meters only gave a total energy of 1832 J. Therefore to provide the most amount of Kinetic Energy we need to start with the highest potential energy so we need to make the initial drop start at a height of 5 meters. 

   The next step in our process is adding our hills, we discovered that for the car to make it over the hill the initial drop height has to be greater than the hill height. This can be explained through the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy can neither be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one type of energy to another. To get over the hill you need a large amount of Kinetic Energy and to get that Kinetic Energy you have to start with that same amount of potential energy which you can only get from the initial drop. So if the initial drop isnt higher than the hill, the coaster wont have the energy it needs to get the car over the hill. 

   Our most recent study was investigating which mass for the car would be the best at providing energy. In this experiment we discovered that our highest mass of 60 kg with the same height of the initial drop it provided a potential energy of 2938. However the lowest mass we tested of 40 kg with every other aspect also remaining the same, we saw a potential energy of 1959 J. As previously explained to have the best experience you need a lot of energy and the mass of 60 kg does that. 

In conclusion as explained through the data, for the best roller coaster results we suggest an initial drop of 5 meters, a hill height of 3.75 m, and a car mass of 60 kg, the riders will be safe, thrilled, and happy with their roller coaster experience! Well wishes, more updates will be sent later in the study.

"Dear Gonzalez family 
Here are my findings from our research on rollercoasters. First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy. Then we studied hills and we learned if the hill is the same height or bigger than the initial drop the cart doesn't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill. Then we did mass and energy we learned that the heavier carts had more energy than the lighter carts. But my takeaway on how to make the longest roller coaster is having a big first drop that has a lot of potential energy that can be turned into kinetic energy. So you can have a long fun and thrilling ride. ",0,0,1,1
"dear Gonzales family
I think you should have a high hill the highest you can. cause it has more potential energy at the top. And a lot of ke at the bottom and more total energy in my studies the tallest was the best. and if you did it too small there would be no speed no energy it would not be fun. in the middle height, you just won't have enough energy as the highest one. if you are going to add a hill do it 3/4 up cause it has more pe energy and ke and you can't do it too high cause then it will just go back down the hill. if you do it too small it just won't have as much energy. for the weight of the cart. you want to make it as heavy as you can cause that has the most energy pe and ke and total that will bring you the most. the smaller it is the least the energy the bigger it is the more the energy. pe is energy that turns into ke and it will make the cart go faster. than if it had a lower ke.",1,1,1,1
"       I will be talking about the most fun and safe roller coaster design for the Gonzales family. the roller coaster will have a 5m ID and a car that weighs 60kg. It will also have a 4.75m hill directly after the initial drop.
       The science behind the roller coaster is that the 5m drop will give it a lot of energy to go up and over the hill. This is due to the force known as gravity, and adding a 60kg car will make it drop faster thus making the ride more fun. The data shows this because the initial drop data, states that a 2m ID only has 977J of total energy while the 5m drop has 2443J of total energy. Then for the data of mass and energy, a 60kg car on a 5m drop has 2938.
       The 4.75m hill is important to the ride because it's fun to go up hills. The way how the car is able to make it up the hill without a boost is because the hill is shorter than the initial drop. This is shown by adding hills when the initial drop is 5m while the hill height was also 5m. The car was not successful in making it up and over the hill. That is why the hill is 4.75m tall being just under 5m making sure the cart is able to make it over.
       all these reasons show why my roller coaster is the most fun and safe design.",0,0,0,0
"          Recommendations for the Gonzales family about your best roller coaster design. The roller coaster will be exciting and make it to the end without stopping. For this to happen you need the initial drop to be higher than the hill. 
          
          First, you need a height that is higher than the hill so lets put it at 5.00m for the initial height and 3.00m for the hill. This way the cart will be able to make it over safety and create a exiting experience for the riders. Using the data I have collected from Initial drop when it was at 5.00m there was a lot more PE and KE resulting in more TE all together making is a better ride for riders to enjoy. 

            Secondly, using the data I have collected from adding hills simulation when the initial height was at 5.00m and the hill height was at 3.00m there was the most TE making it a faster ride. As the data shows PE at the top of initial drop was at 2446J  and the PE and the top of the hill was 1474J creating a lot of KE to follow. This is called energy transformation this is when one type of energy in this case PE is converted into KE as the cart starts to go downward. 

          Lastly, you want to have a heavier cart mass. Because when you have a heavier cart mass the amount of TE will go up. As it shows in my data from mass & energy when the mass of the cart was at 60kg rather than 40kg. So when it was at 60kg the total energy was 2932J and when at 40kg the total energy was at 1954J.  This shows to have a exiting ride you want to a heavier cart mass to have a faster and more entertainment for the riders. 

            In conclusion I would recommend higher initial drop than the hill and a heavier cart mass to have the most TE you can have.  This will create the most enjoyable ride for the riders. I hope you leanred what it takes to have a fun usable ride and will choose my design.

"The Gonzales family should have a high initial drop, a hill shorter than the initial drop and a heavy car. 

My reason for why there should be a high initial drop is because it increases the amount of potential energy on the ride. When you have a greater amount of potential energy, you will in turn have a greater amount of kinetic energy. Because of the law of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that increasing the potential energy will make the roller coaster have more kinetic energy as it moves. In ""Initial Drop Data"" it showed that the tallest drop which was 5m had the greatest amount of energy 2443J.

My reason for why the hill should be shorter than the initial drop is because the car will not make it to the end of the ride. In ""Adding Hills Data"" my data showed, when my hill was the same height as my initial drop (5m) it did not make it to the end.

My reason for a heavy car is that it increases potential energy. Due to it's higher mass the potential energy rises, this also causes kinetic energy to be greater as when the car moves it's potential energy converts to be kinetic energy as it goes downhill. In ""Mass and Energy Data"" it shows that when my car's mass was at the highest (60kg) it had 2937J of energy causing it to not stop until the end.

All in all my reasoning and evidence show that the initial height should be taller than the hill height as well as the car should be heavy.",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales Family, 
  If you want to have the best roller coaster possible you should have a pretty high initial drop height and also you can add some hills into it. If you are going to add hills onto it the roller coaster you need to make sure that the hill is smaller than the initial drop height or else your cart will not be able to make it over. For example when the initial drop height is 5 m and the hill height is 5 m the cart can not make it over. 
  The cart mass also comes into this, if you have a lighter car it will have less PE at the top and less KE at the bottom of the drop. If the cart weighs 40 kg it has 1959 PE at the top and 1955 KE at the bottom of the drop. Compared to a cart that has a heavier mass. Such as a cart with a mass of 60 kg, this cart has 2938 PE at the top of the drop and 2932 KE at the bottom.
  Initial drop height can effect what happens to the KE, PE, and total energy. An example of this is when we have a initial drop height of 2 m there is going to be more PE at the top and less KE. But once you get to the bottom of it there is more KE and no PE. This also goes for any height that you have. Whatever PE you have at the top of the initial drop is going to be the same as the total energy.When there was a initial drop height of 3.5 m there was 1710 PE and 0 KE, but once you got to the bottom there was 1 PE and 1709 KE and a total of 1710 energy. Once you get closer towards the bottom the energy starts to transfer from one to another.
  So when you take cart mass, initial drop height, and hill height into consideration, these things can determine whether the coaster will work  or not work. You need to make sure you have a initial drop height taller than the hill height if you want the cart to get over.  And depending on the height of the initial drop can determine the amount of PE, KE, and total energy from a roller coaster.",0,0,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family,

I am writing today about why my rollercoaster is the better design. The reason for this assumption is that I have found many ways to make this rollercoaster the most fun, safe and can make it to the end of the track. 

I will start to talk about the Initial drop and hill heights. The initial drop has to be higher than the hill height because the rollercoaster will not make it over the hill if they are the same. I tested this by making the initial drop height 5m tall and the hill height also being 5m tall. When the rollercoaster started at the top of the initial drop, it had 2449J of Potential Energy and 0J of Kinetic Energy. Once the cars dropped down the hill, the carts used all of the Potential Energy and made it up to the top of the hill. Once the car was at the top of the hill, all of its Kinetic energy was forced back into Potential energy and was left with no more Kinetic energy to keep moving over the hill. That experiment shows that the hill height has to be lower than the Initial drop height otherwise the cars will not get over the hill.

The relationship between KE, PE, and total energy will affect everyone's ride when they are on the rollercoaster. The Law of Conservation of Energy is: Energy can not be created or destroyed. The higher the initial drop is, the more energy you will have, and based on the mass of the car, the faster it will go. What I mean by that is when the Energy is higher and the Mass is higher, the cars will move faster on the track. I also tested this out by having a starting initial drop height of 5m, the amount of total energy is 2938J, and the mass of the car is 60kg. This was the biggest mass I was able to test. When I tested the smaller mass of 40kg, and an initial drop of 5m tall, the total energy was only able to get up to 1959J. This can show us that the rollercoaster cars should have a bigger mass for the rollercoaster to be faster. 

One more thing I have been watching is how the energy is able to change from PE to KE. When the rollercoaster starts up higher it will have more PE at the top and more total energy all together. Once the cars start to move down the initial drop, the PE will get lower and will turn into KE which will get higher. The reason for that is because once the cars start to move, the KE will get higher because it's in motion. When the cars start to up the hill, the KE will get lower and the PE will get higher. The reason for this is because its gaining more energy when going up the hill so the KE will turn into PE.

I hope you will conseder my options and all the tests I took to find the best option for your future rollercoaster.

"The Gonzales family should make sure to have the initial drop of this fun and safe roller coaster higher than the hills and loops. This is because if the initial drop is higher than the hills and loops, there will be more total energy to go over the hills and loops. But if there isn't enough total energy, the cart will not make it over the hills.

  The Gonzales family needs to make the initial drop higher than the hills and loops so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill and around the loop. For example, in my data on Adding hills, when I set the hill height to 5.0 m and the initial drop to 5.0 m. The cart was not able to make it over the hill because there wasn't enough total energy, PE, and KE. And the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy cannot be created or destroyed. So setting the height of the hills lower than the initial drop, will provide enough energy. And to have more total energy to get over things, the initial drop needs to be higher than the hills and loops. This proves that the Gonzales family needs to make sure that their initial drop is higher than the hills, so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill. Also, when I set the hill height to 4.75 m. There was enough total energy to make it over the hill when the initial drop height was 5 meters. This shows that even making the slightest change, can stay provide enough energy to make over the hill. Still having it be fun and safe. Also they should make sure the mass of the cart is at 50, so then there won't be any problems with having a heavy cart.

   Overall, I think that the Gonzales family needs to make their initial drop higher than the hills and loops. This is so then there can be enough total energy to make it over the hills and around the loops. So then everybody who rides the ride will have a fun, enjoyable, exciting, and safe experience.",0,0,0,0
"            My Claim is that I can help the Gonzales family make a new and better roller coaster. In order to make a new and exciting roller coaster we needed to know how to make a collar coaster and all the parts that go into making a roller coaster. 
           One thing that goes into making a roller coaster is the potential and Kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy that is stored in an object and Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion. When you have an initial drop you start with all the potential energy (PE) has you start to go down the drop your PE transfers in Kinetic energy (KE). When you start at the top of a hill you will see that all of the potential energy is stored into that object. When you go down the hill you will see that the PE starts to transfer over the Kinetic because of it's motion. 
         Another thing we needed to know about making a new roller coaster is how we are able to finish the entire ride with just one initial drop. We found out that the initial drop needs to be higher than the hill in order to make it to the end. If you have a drop of 5.00 m and a hill of 5.00 m you aren't going to make it all the way because there isn't enough energy stored. On the drop the potential energy is the total energy and then decreases towards the bottom but on the top of the hill the potential energy and the kinetic energy equals the total energy. If we look at my add a hill data we can see that all the rides made it all the way through except the one that had the same hill height has the initial drop. If you look at the other hill heights they are all below 5.00 m and they made it all the way through to the end.  
       One last thing we needed to know was the mass and the relationship it has with PE and KE. The more your cart weighs on your ride the more potential energy it will have. The less your cart weighs the less energy your cart will have stored. 
        These things that I have told you about are all things we are going to need in order to make a new and exciting roller coaster. You need to know the potential and kinetic energy , you need to know is how to make a ride that can finish all the way through. The last thing you need to know is the relationship between potential , kinetic and mass. All these things go into making a roller coaster. I think the Gonzales family should choose my ride because I will make sure that my ride is safe , fun and includes all things that go into a ride. ",0,0,1,1

Roller coasters that have an initial drops, and hills make it exciting. This is why, the height of your initial drop relates to your PE at the top and the KE at the bottom. Here is how, the law of conservation of energy states that energy can't be destroyed nor made. So the amount of energy from the top of the roller coaster is how much energy you have. When you go down the hill all of the PE moves to be KE. So at the top you may have 2,443 PE but then at the bottom of the hill you only have 1 PE. Meanwhile the KE has 0 at the top while 2,442 at the bottom. You also have the relationship between PE,KE and total energy and how it affects the ride. The more the energy you have at the start the better. If you only have 1,000 KE the ride is going to be pretty boring. But if you have a ride with 2,400 that ride is going to be exciting. The less energy you have the more it is going to be boring. Hills are tricky, The hill and the initial drop can't be the same. Because if they are then the cart can't go over. There isn't enough energy to go over the hill if they are the same height. For example if the initial drop is 5m and the Hill height is 5m. It won't make it over it will just go back and forth and go nowhere.Meanwhile if you had a initial drop that was 5m while the hill height was 4m it can make it over. So the initial drop has to more than the hill height otherwise it won't make it. There is also mass. The more mass you have the more energy you will have. For example if your cart weights 40 kg it will have a total energy of 1,958. But, if you cart weighs 60kg it will have a total energy of 2,937. That is all you have to know about roller coaster to make a good design.",0,0,1,1
"To have a fun and safe roller coaster, the roller coaster's initial drop should be 5m because you want to have the most PE possible. By going down the initial drop there is more PE turning into KE.
The hill should not be bigger than 5m the height of the initial drop, this is because energy can't be created or destroyed so the hill height should be at least 4m tall. 
The total energy is the same amount of PE at the initial drop and PE+KE-=TE. To make sure that the ride is safe you got to make sure you have enough KE to make it over the hill.
The mass of the car should be 60kg to get the most energy, this is because the more mass the is the faster the car will move down the initial drop and over the hill.",0,0,0,1
"Dear Gonzales family,we have come up with the best possible design for your coaster.We have figured out the best way to make sure the coaster will be safe but also fun.

For starters you will want a release height as high as you can have it.The higher you start your coaster the more total energy it has meaning it will have more potential and kinetic energy so it will go faster and farther.As shows in out data when when we released  a coaster from a height of 5m  the total energy was 2321J but when we released one from a height of 3.49m the total energy was only 1705J.
Also you will want your initial drop height to be higher than every hill you will have.This is because if it is not higher than those hills it will not have enough total energy to be  able to make it over the hills and to the end.This is shown in our data when we released a cart and the hill was at 4.4m and the initial drop height was 5m the cart made it over.However when the hill was at 5m,same as the initial drop height it didn't make it over the hill. 

Secondly you will want to have the cart mass be as much as possible.The more mass the cart has the more energy it will have. Meaning it will be a more thrilling ride.For example in out data we discovered when we kept the initial drop height and hill height the same but changed the mass we got different total energy's.When we gave the cart a mass of 60kg it had 2938j but when we lower'd the mass of the cart to 40 kg it only had 1959j.

So after testing and putting all out data together we have coem up with the best design for your roller coaster.",1,1,1,1
"My claim is that I can help the Gonzalez family make a safe and thrilling roller coaster. To have a safe roller coaster you have to make sure that the cart is safe and that the drops and twists are safe as well. You also need to have enough energy from the initial drop to make it all the way to the end of the roller coaster. When thinking of energy the only way for the cart to make it to the end is to have a high and fast initial drop. When the drop is higher there is more Potential energy stored. Then when the cart drops the stored PE converts into Kinetic energy allowing the cart to get to the end. In the roller coaster simulation the highest drop (5.00) had the most stored energy (PE) so it could go the farthest. 
The next thing you need is a hill. When thinking of a roller coaster hill they usually give you air time and are really fun after the initial drop. When creating my design I wanted the hill to be as high as it could. But when you are building a hill, the hill cannot be higher than the initial drop. The hill also cannot be the same height. If the hill were higher or the same height the cart would not be able to get over it. This is because there is not enough stored energy from the drop to make it to the top of the hill that is the same or higher. When you have a hill that is a great height to make it over then it will be perfect for the roller coaster. When the cart is nearing the top of the hill the potential and kinetic energy evens out to equal the total energy.
 As soon as the cart gets over the hill the potential energy starts to decrease again. In my simulator I put the hill at 4.25 because it was shorter than the 5.00 initial drop but high enough to still be thrilling. When thinking to both drops the potential energy starts with all the energy the roller coaster has. At the top the potential energy is the total energy and the KE is 0. then as the cart goes down the potential energy is 0 and the kinetic energy is the total. But when the energy converts it is never adding more energy. This goes with the Law of Conservation. The Law of Conservation states, ¨Energy cannot be created or destroyed This means that the total energy will always stay the same no matter if the potential energy is higher or the kinetic. The last thing you need for your roller coaster is the mass of the cart. The car with the greatest mass will have the greatest Potential energy at the top of the initial drop. The cart with the greatest mass also had the greatest kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop. In my simulation the 60 kg cart had the greatest amount of energy over the 40 kg cart. In conclusion you now know how roller coasters energy works and you now see that I can make a very fun and safe roller coaster. ",1,1,1,1
"In order to have a safe and exiting ride you will need to have an initial drop, a hill, and mass and energy.

The height of the initial drop has to be higher than the height of any hill. The height of the initial drop was 5. When the height of the hill was 3.20 (lower) the car went over the hill. when the height of the hill was 5 (same) the car didn't go over the hill. 

The higher the initial drop the more total energy there will be. When the initial drop had a height of 2, the TE was 977 J. when the initial drop had a height of 5, the TE was 2443 J. At the top of the initial drop its a PE and as the car goes down the hill it all transfers to KE. KE + PE = TE. 

The more the car weighs the more total energy there is. When the car mass was 40kg the total energy was 1958 J. when the car mass was 60kg the total energy was 2937 J. at the initial drop its a PE and at the bottom of the drop it is mostly KE with a couple PE J. 

My roller coaster design will be exiting because it will be fast have hills, and will make it to the end of the ride. 


",1,1,1,1
"When making roller coasters, It needs to be fun and exciting while still making it to the end of the ride. 

The relationship between PE and KE is, when PE goes down, KE goes up, and this creates the total energy.

Initial drop is important while making a roller coaster. For example when the release height was at 5.00 meters, the potential energy had 2443 Jules. And when the release height was at 2.50 meters, the potential energy had 1222 Jules. The higher the potential energy, the higher number of Jules for kinetic energy, which is needed to make it to the end of the ride. 

When making the roller coaster, hills play a big roll too. In order for the coaster to make it to the end, the hill height must be shorter than the initial drop or else it wont make it to the end of the ride. For example when my hill height was at 5.00 meters with my initial drop at 2.50 meters, the coaster wasn't able to make it up the hill because there wasn't enough potential energy. Then when the hill height was at 2.00 meters the coaster was able to make it up the hill and to the end of the ride because the initial drop was higher up than the hill and had more potential energy. 

The mass of the coaster is important too. When the car mass was at 40kg with an itial drop height of 5.00 meters, the PE had a sum of 1955J. When the car mass was at 60kg with an initial drop height of 5.00 meters, the PE had a sum of 2933J which was more likely to go up the hill and make it to the end of the coaster. 

These are things you need to look for if you want a roller coaster design that will be exciting and make it to the end of the ride without stopping.


",1,1,1,1
"The science behind why my current roller coaster design will be exciting and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping. The science behind it is my car mass is as high as can be, the initial drop is as high as it can be, the hills are as high as they can be without being the same height or higher than the initial height. The height of the initial drop needs to be an high as it can. This is because the higher it is the more PE it has at the top and the less KE at the top. This is also because the higher it is the less PE it has on the top and the more KE at the bottom. The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is PE+KE=TE. It affects the ride because it has to be equal to be able to work. As the car moves down the hill the PE goes up and the KE goes down. The energy transformation is how the energy changes when it goes down a hill or if it si going straight. The law of conservation of energy is how much energy you need to go around the entire roller coaster without using your own energy. The relationship between the initial drop height and the hill height is, the hill height can't be the same height or taller than the initial drop height to be able to make it over the hill. The relation ship between mass, PE and KE is the bigger the mass the more PE you will have at the top of the initial drop. The bigger the mass is the more KE you will have at the bottom of the initial drop.
",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family, 

I believe it's in your best interest for your initial drop height to be higher than your first hill. The roller coaster will not have enough potential energy to make It over the hill if it is higher than the initial drop height. The higher the PE at the top of the initial drop, the higher the KE at the bottom. The higher the KE at the bottom, the better. Because if you want a new and exciting ride, you're going to need a high drop height. The reason for this is that energy cannot be created, so if your drop height is low, the ride isn't going to have enough PE and KE through for it to be exciting. 

I also recommend a heavy cart. My reasoning for this. Is that the cart will go faster down the hill, resulting in a higher speed and more excitement for the riders. 

I hope you will consider my advice. Best wishes, Lin. ",0,1,0,0
"I think that my design would be the most enjoyable ride for your park. My design has 4 inversions and it starts on a big drop that is guaranteed to give you the most speed. The roller coaster will carry speed because every time you go on an inversion you gain speed. You gain speed by turning the KE into PE and then the PE will turn back into KE giving you enough speed for the ride.

The drop height in my trial was 5.00m this was high enough to provide enough total energy to take you through the ride. The PE at the top of the drop affects the amount of KE you will have at the bottom of the drop.

I also tested the different hill heights and how they would effect the ride. The hill height effects the amount of PE you will have at the top of the hill. The more PE you have at the top of the hill affects the amount of KE you will have by the end of the hill. In my trials 4.01m was the best hill height. This is because you have enough energy to make it up the hill. For example if you have a hill that is the same height as the drop you will not make it up the hill. The height of the hill has to be just right to gain more speed and carry it through the ride. 

The inversions would be 3 loops and one 360 roll the loops would all be different sizes. The first loop would be right after the drop and it would be 3.50m tall and wide. After that there would be a hill that leads into a second loop that is 2.60m tall and wide. There would be a turn after that and on that turn there would be a 360 degree roll. Then there would be one last loop that is 2.00m tall and wide and then the ride would be over.

The car mass would be 60kg because the more mass you have the more speed you will have. The mass affects the PE and the PE affects the KE because when moving down a drop all of the PE will turn into KE.
The more mass you have the more PE you will have which makes the ride faster.

"Dear Gonzales family, 
I believe my roller coaster will be the most exiting. Why I believe this is the initial drop is higher than the hill creating momentum to get over the hill and loops, safely to the end of the ride. 

The height of the initial drop is 5.00 m. By the height being this high up and the hill being less, a height of 3.90 m the roller coaster will gain more potential energy making it to the end and creating a thrilling, exiting ride. The higher the initial drop the more total energy there will be making the ride faster. How I know this is in my initial drop data when the initial drop was 5.00 m the potential energy was 2447, making the total energy 2447 because the potential energy at the top of the drop is always the same as the total energy. 

If your hill height is more or the same height as your initial drop, it will not make it to the end of the ride. This is very important because you need to make it to the end of the ride and safely. My data from the adding hills lab shows that when I made the hill height and initial drop height both 5.00 m not only did the roller coaster not make it to the end but its kinetic energy at the top of the hill was significantly lower than all of the other recorded data that made it to the end. So it is highly important to make the initial drop higher then your hill, which my roller coaster has already making it a ride-able and enjoyable roller coaster. 

Also my cart weight is 60 kg. I found out in the mass & energy lab that the more the cart weighs the more potential and kinetic energy there will be, there will also be more total energy making the ride faster and more fun for the riders. So the best way for a roller coaster to be  super fun is to have the mass of the cart be higher. Also to have your initial hill be taller than your hill, and to make the design of your roller coaster be fun for the riders!

These are all reasons why I believe my roller coaster design would make for a very fun and enjoyable ride. As you can see I have learned a lot about what needs to be done to have a great roller coaster, and will continue to learn more throughout the lab. ",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family, I have found out how to make the best roller coaster. To have the most energy you need to have a higher initial drop. Having a higher initial drop gives the roller coaster more total energy which makes it faster. When the roller coaster car moves down the hill it converts its potential energy into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy and potential energy combined make the total energy. The law of conservation of energy shows us that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that if you add a hill to the roller coaster it has to be shorter than the initial drop.",1,1,0,0
"Dear Gonzalez Family,
       During the Roller coaster and energy analysis, we learned about PE and KE at the top of and throughout roller coasters.
     I believe we should make a roller coaster with a release height of 5m. This is the initial drop. We want a higher initial drop because that will create a higher PE. I know this because when I tried it with a drop height of 5m the PE was 2444J. The KE will always be 0 at the top of the initial drop. 
    The higher the PE and KE higher the total energy will be. With higher energy, it will be more of an interesting ride for riders. With more PE it will give the cart more energy to get over hills or loops. Gonzalez family should make a hill height of around 4.51m. I believe they should do this because they will have enough KE from the initial drop to get around the hill.
    The car changes because when the car goes downhill PE and KE stays the same. This is because energy cannot be created or destroyed. That is called the Law of Conservation.
   In the end,  PE and KE can't be created or destroyed. And at the top of the hill PE is always higher than KE and PE and KE always equal the total energy.

"Dear Gonzales family, 
During the roller coaster and energy analysis, we have learned all about potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy, car energy/mass, initial drops, hills, etc. We have also done multiple different simulations to advance our learning in these categories. 
First, we did some learning with initial drops as well as a simulation. In the simulation, I found that the higher the release height the more potential energy the coaster car has at the top of the initial drop, and the lower the initial drop release height the lower the potential energy. The higher the potential energy at the top of the initial drop the more kinetic energy the coaster car had at the bottom. I also noticed throughout the simulation that the potential energy also is the same number as the total energy. For example  the release height of 2.00 had less potential energy (977 J) and the release height of 5.00 meters had 2443 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop. As the coaster car goes down the drop all the energy moves or switches into kintetic energy. 
The second simulation we did deal with adding a hill to the initial drop. I found that the initial drop had to be taller than the the hill following that initial drop, if the hill was higher or the same as the drop the coaster car would not make it over. For example, I did the hill height as 5.00 meters with the initial drop height always being 5.00 meters as well. The coaster car didnt have enough energy to make it over the hill and to the end, but.. the height of 3.70 meters had enough potential energy and kinetic energy to make it over the hill and then end of the track. 
The next simulation we did we learned about the mass and energy of the coaster car. During the simulation, I tested a small mass, 2 medium masses, and 1 heavy mass. I found that the heavy-mass car (60kg) had the most potential energy but was the slowest when tested, compared to the car with the least mass, in this case 40kg. This coaster car had the least potential energy with 1958 J of energy. The more mass the less the speed will be
During these simulations, with the law of conservation of energy.. I have learned that Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can change. ",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family
  So with this roller coaster you are trying to build.For us to build this roller coaster we need some safety requirements.Some of these will be or initial drop height or hill height even the weight of our car these will make the energy change and be bigger and smaller. 

First we will talk about or roller coasters initial drop and hill height.For our heights we will have to make our initial drop height taller than our hill height. The reason for this is because with the first drop we need to create a amount of energy to get over the hill so if our hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop or car will not get over. Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill. So this shows that our hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height.

We do need some things that might help our roller coaster to be fun. We might want our initial drop height to be pretty tall it would create lots of Potential energy at the top of the drop and it will turn into ken-tic energy at the bottom. While this energy transfers between kinetic and potinel because we cant destroy or create energy can only transfer it that is what the law of conversation of energy says. This will create more energy for this coaster to be more fun and have  more inversions. Also if our car weighs more it will create more energy and will help that too we did some experiences to show that the car will create more energy if it weighs more. When the car weighed 40kg it created 1956 joules of energy while the car that weighed 60kg created 2934 joules of energy.

"Hello Gonzales family,
I have discovered that the most optimal roller coaster design involves an initial drop height of 5.00. It is important to ensure that the hill height is not greater than the hill itself. At the top of the initial drop, the potential energy would be 2243, while the kinetic energy would be at 0. As the cart starts to move down the hill, the kinetic energy would be 2243, and the potential energy would be 0. These two forms of energy have a significant impact on the total amount of energy. The greater the potential energy, the greater the kinetic energy, resulting in a greater effect on the total amount of energy. If a coaster cart with a mass of 60 begins to move downhill, there is a change in both its kinetic and potential energy. For instance, if the potential energy at the top of the hill is 2937, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill would be 2930. This change occurs due to the cart's increased speed as it moves downhill, which is caused by its mass. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can only be transformed between potential and kinetic forms. I've learned that the height of the hill cannot exceed the height of the initial drop. For instance, if the initial drop height is 4.59 and the hill height is 5.00, the coaster cart won't be able to go over the hill. The amount of mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy are interrelated, as they all play a crucial role in assisting the coaster cart to traverse over the hill. Based on research, it has been determined that the most efficient height for a roller coaster design is an initial height of 5.00.

"I would tell the Gonzalez family that hills are a great addition to roller coasters however they can't have a hill higher than the initial drop. This has a lot to do with the law of conservation of energy which states that energy cannot be destroyed or created only transferred to a different type of energy. At the initial drop as the coaster car goes down, all the potential energy turns into kinetic energy. When the car starts traveling up the hill, the kinetic energy goes back to potential energy because of the gravity pulling the car back down (this is called gravitational potential energy.) The coaster car doesn't have enough kinetic energy to go up a hill the same size as the initial drop much less one that is bigger. proof of this is in the ""Add a Hill"" experiment. In the last experiment, the hill was the same height as the initial drop (5 m) but it was the only one whose coaster car didn't make it over the hill. In comparison to a different trial in the same experiment, I had a hill height of 4.75 m, just 0.25 m from the initial drop height, and the coaster car got over the hill. It's also worth mentioning that the two coaster cars had the same amount of total energy at 2449 js so the energy didn't have anything to do with the coaster car at the 5 m hill not going over. I would also say that Coaster cars with higher masses tend to have a higher amount of total energy. In the ""Mass & energy"" experiment, I ran experiments with the lightest and heaviest car. The heaviest car had a total of 2938 js while the lightest car had a total of 1959 js, so the heavier the car, the more total energy it will have.  (The mass doesn't affect the ability or inability to get over hills so it won't harm the coaster experience.)",0,0,1,1
"To the Gonzales family. 

This is the Angle roller coaster company, and im going to tell you about the coolest roller coaster ever. I will explain the science behind it and what there will be(hills and drop height, plus the mass of the coaster).

The initial drop will be at 50 meters because it will get a lot PE that will turn into KE for really fast speeds. The more PE there is the more KE there will be, I know this because in one of my test the amount of PE on the top of initial drop was 1956, and the amount of KE at the bottom of drop was 1954. This means the PE transfers to KE when the roller coaster is going down the initial drop.
 
I am going to add 2 hill, one will be 43 meters and the other 39 meters. The hills have to be below the height of the initial drop because if the hills are higher or the same of the initial drop, the coaster will not make it over the hill. This is because in one of my tests I had the hill at 5 meters and the initial drop at 5 meters. The coaster did not make it over the hill because the hill and drop were the same height. I want the hills to be 40 meters because they are tall but not tall enough for the coaster to make it over. The reason I want them tall is because the higher the hill, the more PE. On my 4th test it shows that the hill height is 4.10 meters, and has a PE of 2014 at the top of the hill. My third test has a height of 2 meters and has a PE if 981. This shows that the higher the hill, the more PE which also means more KE as explain previously. 

Also, the mass of the roller coaster has to be above 55 kg or more. The mass of the roller coaster (in kg) effects the amount of total energy. If the coaster has a higher mass the more energy. This has been proven from my 3nd and 4th tests in Mass & Energy data, the mass in the third was 60 kg and had a total energy of 2934. The 4th test had 55 kg of mass and had the total energy of 2690. This shows that the more mass the more total energy. 

With these amazing features and that it will go fast, this is the best roller coaster. I have put a lot of thought into this and hope these recommendations will be helpful. 

Sincerely the Angle company.

"Dear Gonzales Family,

This letter is about your new roller coaster endeavor and what you should have for your coaster so it can be safe, fun, and actually run.

You should use a 5 Meter initial drop because it gives the most energy out of all of the heights I tested for example. the 5 Meter drop gives 2443 Juels of energy while a height of 2 Meters only gives 977 Juels of energy.

You should use a 4.5 meter hill in your coaster because it gives the most energy while still letting the cart get over the hill. A hill height of 4.5 meters, the cart had 2449 Juels of energy and went over the hill but with a hill height of 5. The cart also had 2449 Juels of energy, but the cart did not go over because there is not enough energy in the system to do so.

You should use a cart with a mass of 60 kg because it gave me the most energy out of the different masses I tried for example. a cart with a mass of 60 kg had a total energy of 2938 Juels while a cart with a mass of 40 kg only had an energy of 1959 Juels.

Thank you for considering this proposal and I hope your endeavor pays off.

"Dear Gonzales family, 
     You should build our design because it works well, and people will like it. Here I will prove to you all of the things I just said with data from test runs, logic, and the relation ships between energy and the track. 

     First our design works well, our design was built with speed and success in mind. In our roller coaster design we start off with a high 5 meter drop that will give the roller coaster cart enough energy to follow through with the rest of the coaster. In one of our test drops when the cart fell from 5 meters it went through the entire coaster because when the PE at the top of the coaster is higher, the faster the roller coaster cart will go. So when that cart fell from 5 meters the PE at the top was 2443. When we dropped the roller costar cart from 2 meters it didn't go as fast or as far and make it to the end of the track because the PE at the top was 977. So you should use our design because we have a higher drop and the roller coaster cart makes it to the end of the track successfully. 
     
      Seconded I want to talk about how our roller coaster works well because of the hill. In a roller coaster we all know there are many ups and downs to make it more fun for the rider in our roller coaster we added a hill after the drop out hill is 2 meters tall. Our hill is 2 meters tall so that the roller coaster cart can get over it and it wont stop mid way. In our test drops when we had our hill at 2 meters the cart went over it without a problem because it had enough energy form our 5 meter drop to go over the 2 meter hill. But when we had out hill also at 5 meters the cart failed to go over because it didn't have enough energy form the 5 meter drop to go over it. When adding hills in roller coasters you need to make sure the initial drop is higher then the hill or the cart will not be able to go over it. You should use our design because we added fun and successful hills into our coaster. 

     Third and lastly I wanted to talk about mass and energy relating to our roller coaster. The mass of the cart effects the energy that the cart has for the ride. Our car mass is 60 because the more mass the cart has  the more energy it has to go faster and farther. When we tested the cart mass at 60 it got to the bottom easily because it was heavier vs when we tested it at 40 then it took longer to go down the track. proving that you should use our design because out coaster will go farther then others.

     That is the end of my letter to you I hope this helps you decide that our design is the best and it will work very well.

" Hello Gonzales family! I'm mailing you my essay about how my roller coaster would be the most popular attraction and how it would run flawlessly without any problems with it's design. 

 First it has a fast initial drop down into a tunnel then in slowly climes a hill, gaining 2937 PE to make it over a giant hill. Once it drops converting it all into 2933 KE and allowing it to make it over the hill and into a drop. With a inversion and then slowing down into a flat area keeping the total energy the same because all the PE turned into KE when it went down the initial drop. 
 The cart will be 60Kg because through out my research that's the weigt that gave me the most PE(2937) and KE(2933) energy in all my simulations. 
 And the reason why the initial drop is so much bigger than the hill is because the initial has to have more PE than the hill at the top of it so it can make it over the hill. The flat area also shows that the total energy is just the PE + the KE energy 
 And that Gonzales family is why I know my roller coaster will out preform and work better than any other roller coaster you might see. ",0,0,0,0
"I suggest having a really high drop, a hill that is about 4/5 the size of the initial drop, and the coaster cars should be heavy.

The reason for the high initial drop height is that throughout our testing, we found that the higher the height, the more potential energy the coaster has, and more potential energy, means more kinetic energy. For example, if the initial drop height is  4 meters, i will have 1955 J of energy, while if it has an initial drop height of 5 meters, it will have 2443 J of energy, which is more than 4 meters.

The reason for the hill being about 4/5 the size of the initial drop is that if the hill is the same height as the initial drop, the coaster car will not have enough energy to get to the other side. But if the hills height is shorter than the initial drop height, then the coaster car will make it to the other side.

And the reason for the coaster cars being heavy, is that through out our testing we found that the heavier the car, the more potential energy it has that can be converted to kinetic energy. And if the coaster car is light, it will have less potential energy to be converted.

In short, out design would be the most exciting, and safe roller coaster that you can have.

"Dear Gonzales Family 
I have come to show you y roller coaster that I think you should build. I am going to show you how my roller coaster you should have in you park. My roller coaster has a starting initial drop that no one will suspect. Then there is a hill that you go up at at a 90 degree angle. Then you flip up right and you go in to a loop heading straight in to a hill and turn right away for a huge initial drop turn mid way and then you reach the end.The cart will way about 70 KG(kilograms) and reach up to speeds about 150 MPH(miles per hour)and yes i picked it to go 1 MPH then Formula Rossa .
The starting initial drop would be 50 m drop and the PE (potential energy) would be about 20,000. The hill going up is going up at a 90 degree angle and will flip going into a loop there will be no PE but lots of KE. When getting near the end of the loop you will go into a hill then right in to a drop. 
On the hill there will be very little PE but a lot of KE. When going down there will be lots of PE and a lot of KE. When nearing the end of the initial drop you flip to the up right position and get to the end of the coaster. 
The roller coaster will be about 2 minutes long and i will charge 11 dollars a person. People will need safety goggles and tight safety bars to hold them in. 
There will be no phone allowed and we will hold them tight for the m in compartments behind the ticket counter. I hope you pick my roller coaster. THANK YOU   ",0,0,0,0
"During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about:
How PE  KE and Total Energy works. More mass gives more energy. The initial height needs to be higher than the hill.
The drop height of my roller coaster design is  5 meters.
This is important because.a 5 meters drop gives us the highest PE .
For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.5 meters, the PE was 1222 Joules. When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at  2443 Joules. 

PE + KE = TE  My data supports this equation because in the  Hill simulation my roller coaster had 2444 J of PE at the top of the initial drop. It had 2444 J of KE at the bottom of the initial drop. It had 
2444 J of total energy at the end of the ride. 

The law of conservation of energy states that whatever energy you start with you end with. This means that energy will transfer from potential energy to  kinetic energy and back again throughout the ride.

Any hills that are added to the ride must be lower as compared to the initial drop height. 
You can see this in my data. When I tested a drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 5 m, the roller coaster car did not make it over the hill. However, when I tested a drop height of 5.00m and a hill height of 2.50 m, the roller coaster car went over the hill.

Our last experiment was comparing mass and energy. The higher the mass of the car, the higher the total energy.
When I used a car that had a mass of 40 kg, the roller coaster had 1958 J of total energy. When I used a car that had a mass of 60 kg, the roller coaster car had a total energy 2934j.
",1,1,1,1
"When building this roller coaster, you will need to consider the initial drop height, the hills height and the mass of the cart. All of these play a part in the cart making it to the end of the ride with out it needing to stop or fall back and try to restart. Lets talk about the initial drop height first. The higher the drop height, the more total energy there will be, which means there is room for a lot of potential energy, (PE), and kinetic energy, (KE). At the top of the initial drop height, there will be an x amount of PE, But as the cart moves down the drop it will be converted to KE. This is the process. And the energy will always stay the same do to the law of conservation of energy, which says that energy can not be created nor destroyed, but can be converted to different types. When you want to add a hill, you need to be aware of how tall it will be, or the cart might not be able to get over. For example, in the data we collected, when the initial drop height was 5 m and the hill height was 3.50 m, the cart was able to go over the hill with ease. But when the hill height was 5m as well, the cart was not able to to make it over the hill. This shows that the hill can not be the same height or more higher then the initial drop. This is do to the total energy that is effected by the height of the initial drop, which mean it only has enough total energy for going over hills that are smaller then the initial drop height, which in this case was 5 m. When it comes to mass, it has an effect on total energy as well. The more mass, the more total energy there is. For example, the initial drop height is set at 5 m, and the cart mass is 52 kg. The total energy was 2524 J. Then the cart weight was put at 56 kg, and now the total energy is 2740. This will help when considering hill height and the initial drop height. ",1,1,1,1
"      My recommendation to you Gionzales family is you make your intial drop height 5m tall. Your hill is going to have to be less then the height of your intial drop so I would recommend a height of about 3m. For the mass of you car I recommend about 60kg in weight based on my investigations.
       The reason I said the height of your intial drop should be so tall is so you can get the most energy out of it and it will be more fun to to ride. According to my data when the intial drop was 3m the amount of potential energy  there was, was 1466J compared to the 5m intial drop height which was 2932J of potential energy. So as you can see here the greater of the intial drop, the greater potential energy giving you more energy, the potential energy is transferred into Kinetic energy once the coaster car starts moving. In my data the intial drop of 3m had 1465J of Kinetic energy at the end of the drop, where the 5m intial drop had 2930J of kinetic energy. As you can see the greater height allowed for the potential energy to change into kinetic energy with more than the smaller height amount, making the greater height a better option for your roller coasters intial drop.
       The next part in your roller coaster is going to be a hill. I recommend a height of about 3m, you maybe wondering why it can't be higher then the intial car , and we'll it can but then the coaster car can't make it over the hill, not allowing it to finish the track. I don't even recommend having it super high because the higher it is the less kinetic energy you have making the ride go slower that's why I recommend 3m. According to my trials the hill of 3m had 1768J of potential energy and 582J of kinetic where as 4.5 had 2276J potential energy but only 73J of kinetic energy. So you can see there will be more speed if your hill is shorter but you also want it to be enjoy able so 3m is a good in between height.
       The mass I recommend for you coaster car is 60kg because in my trials I found that the greater the mass of your car the more energy it will have. For example, one of my test was with a car that was 45kg the amount of energy it had at the beginning was 2182J. Where as the amount the car with a mass of 60kg had 2934J of potential energy at the intial drop height. So you can see the coaster car is more likely to go faster if it has a greater mass.
        As you can see Gonzales, the heights and masses I have provided you are good for everything you are looking for in the roller coaster. ",1,1,1,1
"In this essay I'll provide for you a new roller coaster for the Gonzales family theme park that's sure to be a great and exciting add on. I'm going to tell you how the science behind the roller coaster works and how people may find this roller coaster fun.

So for the initial drop part of the roller coaster I've decided to make it 5 meters high, which at the top the PE is 2447 J and at the bottom is 1 J. While the KE at the top is 0 J and at the bottom is 2445 J. The KE and PE tells us how much total energy is in the ride itself and how the energy transfers from PE to KE. Since the Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created nor dystroyed but it can be transferred so by the PE transfering to KE it follows the law. But the total energy of the ride is what the coaster starts with at the top of the hill. So the total amount of energy is equal to the first amount of PE.

For the Add a Hill portion of the roller coaster I've decided to make the hill 3.15 meter high. With the PE on top of the hill as 1547 J and the KE is 904 J. Since there's still KE near the top of the hill that gives it that force to make it over the hill. The reason why it's shorter than the initial drop height is because whenever the hill is either taller or the same height as the initial drop height the roller coaster can't make it up that high because it doesn't have enough energy. So having a smaller hill will help the coaster car get over the hill successfully. 

And finally for the Mass and Energy portion so depending on how heavy your coaster is the more or less PE and KE it will have during the ride. So for my roller coaster design I decided that the car mass would be 55 kg with the PE being 2673J and KE at the bottom being 2657 J. But if it had 45 kg as the mass of the car the PE would be 2214 J and the KE at the bottom would be 2188 J. Compared to each other 55kg Has more PE and KE so the more mass the more PE and KE.

As I conclude this essay I hope you take into consideration of how the roller coaster works and the science behind it, and hopefully make it the new add on to the Gonzales family theme park. To have the roller coaster be exciting and fun for people in the future.",0,0,1,1
"Greetings Gonzales family as you know I have made a design for your roller coaster. I think the initial drop height should be 60 m and then have a hill that is 50 m tall and I will explain to you why I think this.
You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 60 m.  I didn't want to make it too tall and have it take up too much space but I also didn't want it to be boring.  Then there will be a hill of 50 m.  The reason I have the hill as 50 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.  For example when I did an Initial Drop height of 5 m and had a hill height of 5 m it didn't go over the hill because it did not have enough energy.  For example when I had a drop height.  The amount of energy there is depends on how much PE and KE there is.  Because PE and KE added together equal the total amount of energy.  And the initial drop affects the amount of PE because the higher the drop height the larger amount of PE there is.  And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.  This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy which means that energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be transferred.  So since the total amount of energy is the PE and KE combined the total energy never changes because the energy is only transferred.  For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 m the PE at the top of the drop was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.  At the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1221 J and the total energy was 1222 J.  When I had a drop height of 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J.  Then at the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1442 J and the total energy was 1443 J.  Now for an example of why the hill height has to be shorter I will show you some more evidence.  When I had an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill 5 m the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2450 J and 0 J for KE.  But then at close to the top of the hill the PE was 2449 J and 1 J for KE and it didn't have enough energy to get back up the hill and over.  But when I had an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 4 m it was able to go over the hill.  At the initial drop the PE was 2448 J and the KE was 0 J.  Then at the top of the hill the PE was 2450 J and the KE was 489 J and had enough energy to go over the hill.  This is why I have the hill height at 50 m, to make sure that the car will have enough energy to go over the hill and make it safely to the end.
All of this is why you should choose my design for an initial drop height of 60 m and a hill height of 50 m.  Thank you for your time.

"I designed a roller coaster that might just be the trick to attract visitors. My coaster design will be fun to ride on since it features loops and wraps around the track every now and then. The car on my design should also be able to make it to the end of the track since the initial drop height is higher than the highest point mid-run. Let's go into depth with each of those points.

My roller coaster design has a lot of twists and turns that make the roller coaster more fun than other rides. Here's how the coaster will go, starting from the initial drop. Starting from the steep initial drop, you'll start off pretty fast and then you'll go through a loop. After the loop, you pass through the middle of said loop and wrap around the track that leads up to the loop. After wrapping around the track, you go underneath, wrap around that track again, and go down another steep drop, and the ride then ends. 

Also, using my design for the roller coaster, the car should be able to make it to the end without a problem. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that the amount of energy in a closed system will remain the same. It also states that said energy can only be converted from one form to another. Since this roller coaster is technically a closed system, all of the energy it will ever have will remain at the same amount and can only be converted. At the beginning of the coaster, potential energy starts being converted to kinetic energy as the car falls down the track. At the lowest point after the drop and before the loop, the car will be moving at its fastest speed. Since the top of the loop is lower than the initial drop, the car will be able to make it over. We can prove this using data from some of my runs of a simulation. That is because the car still has some kinetic energy left after the drop and not all of the kinetic energy has converted back to potential. With an initial drop height of 4.5 meters and a hill height of 4 meters, the coaster was able to make it to the end. This is because the car still had 276 joules of kinetic energy at the top of the hill after the drop. However, if this loop were higher than the initial drop, the car wouldn't make it to the end since all of the kinetic energy would be exhausted and the car would move backwards. We can see this with another one of my data points. With an initial drop height of 4.5 meters and a hill height of 5 meters, the car couldn't make it to the end of the track. This is because the car had converted all 2,558 joules of kinetic energy back to potential energy before the car could even make it to the top of the hill. My roller coaster design has a drop height greater than the height of the loop, so it will be able to make it after the loop. After that first loop, the track keeps going downward, so the car is guaranteed to have enough kinetic energy to make it to the end of the track.

In conclusion, my roller coaster design will be really fun, plus the car will be able to make it to the end without backtracking at the same time. The roller coaster would be fun because of its unique design, and the car would make it without fail with its high drop height. I hope you will consider making my design a reality so that visitors can have a blast at your park!",1,1,1,0
"You should use my roller coaster recommendation because it has the appropriate initial drop height in order for the coaster car to make it to the end of the ride. Because I will have the initial drop height at 400m  and the first loop at 300m, that car will be able to make it past that loop. After that loop there is another loop that is 250m tall, so again it should make it past there. Then there is a down hill and a corkscrew with very small bumps at the end. The reason we make the initial drop height higher than the loop is because if the loop is taller you will not have enough energy. The higher you go the more PE you have, and the more PE you have the more KE you have. For example, when I tested the drop height at 2m the PE was 1173(J), but when I tested the height at 5m the PE was 2932(J). When the car goes up the loop it will need enough energy to make it over. For example, a hill height of 5000m needs 7000(J) to make it over, but the initial drop height of 4500m only gives 4750(J) it will not be able to get over. Because energy cannot be created or destroyed only transferred from one form of energy to another the amount of energy will stay the same and stay lower than the amount needed to get around the loop. When I did the test I saw that when the initial drop height was 5m and the hill was 5m the car did not make it over, but when the hill height was 4m the car did make it over. I would also recommend a car with a big mass. The more mass the car has the more PE it will have at the top of the drop. And because the PE is the greatest, the TE will also be the greatest. When I had a car that had a mass of 40kg it only had 1958(J) at the top of the initial drop. But when I had a car that was 60kg it had a PE of 2973(J). So if you want the ride to be safe you need to have the hill height shorter than the initial drop height. Also you need to have enough energy to get to the end of the track so you want to have a high initial drop and a big car mass to give it the most TE possible. Also if you want the ride to be fun, you will want a high drop height and a lot of energy.",1,1,1,1
"Through lots of research, I have figured out the requirements and recommendations for the best roller coaster design so far. The amount of energy during the initial drop correlates with the height of it. If you want the car to have more KE at the bottom and more PE at the top, choose a high initial drop. If you want less KE at the bottom and less PE at the top, choose a lower initial drop. This is shown in my data. When the initial drop was 2 meters tall, the car only had 1071J of energy. When the initial drop was 5 meters tall, the car had 2688J of energy. I recommend a higher initial drop to thrill the riders with more speed. A higher initial drop allows the cart to build up more speed and allows you to have higher hills. If you want a hill, it needs to be lower than the initial drop. The car needs enough KE to go over the hill. If the hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop, the car won't have enough KE to make it over.  All of the KE will transfer into PE before the car makes it over and the cart will lose it's speed. This is shown in my data. When I did an initial height of 5 meters and a hill height of 5 meters, the cart did not make it over. When i did a hill height of 4 meters and an initial drop of 5 meters, the car made it to the end.Keep in mind that the total amount of energy never changes. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. When the car is going up, it's losing KE and speed but gaining PE. When the car is going down, it's gaining KE and speed but losing PE. I recommend a hill slightly lower than the initial drop so the riders can experience two high drops. You should also think about the mass of the car. The mass of the car effects the amount of energy and the speed. If you want more energy and more speed, you should have a car with a higher mass. If you want less energy and less speed, you should have a cart with less mass. Examples of this are shown in my data. When I did a car mass of 40kg, the car had a total energy of 1957J of energy and went a decent speed. When I did a car mass of 60kg, the car had a total energy of 2936J of energy and went much faster. I also observed that the car with a higher mass lost speed faster when going up. This is because gravity has more of an effect on the heavier object.",1,1,1,1
"In this essay, I will be providing you, the Gonzolas family with information on why you should add my roller coaster to your theme park.
First, we need to make sure we have a safe initial drop. The initial drop on my roller coaster is 5.00m this is because it had the highest PE and KE in joules while still being safe for the hill and loop. If the coaster car is at the top of the hill the PE will be 1955 J and the KE at the top of the hill will be 0 J. This is because all the KE has not been built up yet. Let's say the coaster car was in the middle of the initial drop the KE and PE would both be around 977.5 J because the PE is transferring over to the KE.
Then, we would have to calculate the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy we can figure this out by looking at this example from our data If the initial drop is 5.00m high the PE at the top of the hill would be 1995 J and the KE would be 0 J 1995 plus 0 equals 1995 which would be the total energy. So the equation would be PE plus KE equals total energy.
Now, we have to add a hill we need to make sure that the coaster car has enough speed to get over the hill. Our initial drop will be 5.00m so we cannot have anything equal to or over that or it will not go over. At the top of the hill the PE is 1995 J and the KE should be at 0 J. Theoretically this means as the coaster car goes down the hill the PE will transfer over to KE making it equal around the middle of the hill. At the end of the coaster, there will be no PE and all KE.
Furthermore, the law of conservation of energy states ""Energy can not be created or destroyed."" we can look at our data and find that in the middle of the initial drop of 5.00m that the PE is transferring to KE and still equaling the total energy of 1955 J. This statement proves that the law of conservation of energy is backed up by evidence from research.
After, we must concur that our hill and drop height rely on each other. If the initial drop height is 5.00 the hill height cannot be the same or love it or it will not be able to get over but where we still have enough energy to get over the loop after the hill. If the drop height is lower than the hill the coaster car will go backwards. If the hill is too low compared to our initial drop it could cause injuries to passengers aboard.
Finally, the mass has a big play in the speed and energy of the roller coaster for example. The greater the mass of the coaster car the greater the total energy the car has to get to the end of the track. Also The greater the mass of the coaster car the greater the total energy the car has to get to the end of the track.  Evidence from our data will further prove this point in my first trial my car mass was 40kg and the total energy was 1995 J but in my last trial with a coaster car of 60kg, the total energy is 2933. These pieces of evidence prove that mass and energy have a big relationship with PE and KE.
I hope this detailed info page about my coaster proved to you that my roller coaster will be the best and safest option for your guests. Thank You sincerely ______________

"The Gonzales family should use my roller coaster design because it meets the criteria they are looking for. It is exciting, and the cart makes it to the end of the ride. The Gonzales family should have a roller coaster with a drop height of 5.00 m, because it will increase the amount of potential energy that is used to get the cart to the end without stopping. For example in Trial 1, the initial drop height of the roller coaster was 5.00 m. Which caused the Potential energy at the top of the drop to be 2443 J, and the Kinetic energy at the top of the drop to be 0 J. This is important because the higher the Initial drop height, means the higher the total amount of energy. As the ride ended, the potential energy at the bottom of the drop was 2443 J, and the Potential energy at the bottom was 0 J. As the cart moves through the ride, the Potential energy converts to Kinetic energy, because as the Law of Conservation of Energy states, energy cannot be created or destroyed. They should also add a hill in order for it to be more fun for the riders. The trials showed that a hill height of 3.00 m would have a total energy of 2466 J. The hill cannot be higher than the initial drop height, otherwise the cart will not make it over the hill. If the Gonzales family added the 3.00 m hill, the ride would be more fun, but still make it to the end of the ride. The mass of the cart which holds the riders, should be 50 kg. Data showed that the higher the mass of the cart, the more total energy the cart would have. The Gonzales family should use my roller coaster design because it meets the standards of the roller coaster they are looking for.",1,1,0,1
"For you, the Gonzalez family, we have created an exciting quick but safe roller coaster design! Some of your ideas (such as hills higher than drops) cannot be implemented due to energy issues I will further explain in future paragraphs. I can assure you after I explain the science behind how these coasters work, and how we will build your coaster, you will love this design. 

The first important implementation of the coaster will be the drop, which we will make at a height of 5 meters. With this starting height, you will get the maximum amount of potential energy that height can affect. This allows the coaster to have a lot of potential energy that will convert into the kinetic energy necessary to get over any hills. How this system works is the potential energy in the start equals the total energy, and as the coaster goes on that potential energy turns into kinetic energy (all while still equaling the same amount of total energy). Basically, the system never loses or creates energy, it simply converts it.
 
Now, a roller coaster cant just have a drop, which is why we have decided it should have numerous hills to go over! These hills will all be lower than the initial drop height, but just barely. For the car to get to the end of a ride, it must be able to get over the hills, which is impossible if the hills are the same height or taller than the initial drop. This is because to get over a hill of equal or taller height, the cart would need more potential energy than the drop gave it. This is physically impossible due to energy not being able to be created or destroyed, and therefore the hills have to be shorter. To add to the excitement we will make the hills go in order getting slightly smaller each time to make sure the cart can get to the end. With smaller drops in the start of the hill, there will be less and less KE converting each time as it moves down the hill. This will keep it fast, but slow enough to safely stop.  The first hill will be 4.75 meters, the second will be 4.5 meters, the third will be 4.25 meters, the fourth will be 4 meters,  and the fifth will be 3 meters.

The third thing we considered when designing your coaster was the weight of the car. After a lot of consideration, we have decided that a car of 60 kilograms would best suit your coaster. We have decided on this weight due to the amount of potential energy a car with a greater mass has, compared to a smaller one. Cars with greater mass have been proven through experiments to carry significantly more potential energy, showing that mass effects the total energy in an object. As the car moves down this significant amount of energy will convert into as much kinetic energy possible that you could safely have. If you combine this with how tall the drop will be, the coaster will be extremely fast, making it all the more exciting.  
 
Our decision was carefully made so a drop height of 5 meters, 5 hills that get smaller, and a car with a mass of 60 kilograms, is the best design choice. All of these design choices combined will, and I assure you with my full confidence, make one of the most exciting and safe coasters in your park.",0,0,1,0
"  My team's roller coaster is the best design with much exciting parts and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping. The Gonzales family should love my ride because it contains much thrill, high drops, and very powerful. 
  According to data from my simulations my initial drop height is 5 m. My roller coaster is way more exciting than others because it creates lots more speed from how high the initial drop is. Since my roller coaster will have lots of speed to it, it will have enough kinetic energy to ride up the next hill. As a result of having lot's of kinetic and potential energy this will make my roller coaster have more thrill and excitement to my ride. My roller coaster cart changes quickly along the tracks. When it's cart is at the bottom of the hill, it's moving it fastest. Since all of the potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy, which means tons a speed and tons of fun. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can change forms, but energy can't be created or destroyed. On my roller coaster energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again. My data states that the best height of a hill is 4 m. It's the best height for my hill because it will have enough kinetic energy to ride over the hill since the hill height isn't taller or the same height as my initial drop. My data from my simulations prove that the best car mass is 56 kg. The larger the mass the larger the momentum. You want a lot of momentum since that creates more kinetic energy and it will be harder to slow down so my roller coaster won't stop. So I believe that 56 kg is the best car mass for my roller coaster which makes my roller coaster safe and fun.
    In conclusion the Gonzales Family should follow my recommendations about my best roller coaster design. My best roller coaster design should conclude an initial drop height of 5 m, hill height 4 m, and best car mass as 56 kg. This will cause much excitement and thrill to many people and it will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.  ",1,1,1,1
"Today, I will be telling you about the best design you can do for your new roller coaster, it will have the most speed, the most exciting, and most importantly, it will be safe. The following writing is the best roller coaster to make.
 For your initial drop, you are going to want to make the highest coaster you can, you want to do this because it will have the most total energy and will have the most speed off of the initial drop. When we were testing and experimenting with the best roller coaster, we noticed that when the initial drop was lower, the amount of Joules was severely slower than that of a higher drop. In trial 1, the drop was 5 meters. The total energy was 2932. It started as potential energy and once the car got moving it quickly became kinetic energy that moved the fastest out of all trials. In trial 2 of testing the initial drops, we set the height to 2 meters. This severely impacted the amount of energy the coaster had, at a measly1173 joules of energy, a whole 1000 less than the 5-meter height, a higher height will have more kinetic energy at the bottom and more at the top. Potential energy is the energy pent up inside mass, ready to be put in motion, that is kinetic energy. Energy never gets destroyed or created, this is called the law of conservation of energy. It shifts from one to the other, kinetic energy is the speed and motion part of energy determining how fast the coaster goes. You should choose the highest drop height to maximize the enjoyment of the ride and increase speed.
For your hill height, it must be less than the initial drop height if you want to get the car over the hill. The hill requires a certain amount of energy and for the coaster, we are making we will not have enough energy to make it up a higher hill without support from other forces. In trial 3 of adding hills, the hill height was 4 meters and the initial drop height was 5 meters. The car was safely able to make it over the track in the first run with more than enough energy, at a total of 2937 joules. However, when running trial 4, the hill height was 5 meters and the initial drop was also 5 meters. This trial did not have enough energy to make it up and was stuck going right up to the top and falling back down never stopping. When going up a hill you can feel the coaster slowing down. This is kinetic energy being converted into potential energy, when the car makes it over the hill, the potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy and starts to gain speed going down the hill. This car had the exact same amount of energy and was not able to make it through the ride, this is why you need to make a hill smaller than the initial drop height.
Lastly, you must consider the weight of the coaster, this is essential to the amount of total energy you want in your coaster. When we were running our trial on the mass of the coaster car, we had our hill height at 4 meters and our drop height at 5 meters. We had the coaster weight at 40 kg for trial 1. The total energy was
 1958 joules of energy, this would impact the speed because gravity is always pulling down, gravity will act faster if the car is heavier, this trial was the slowest out of all of them. When we ran our 4th trial, we had set the car to 60 kilograms. We had our hill and initial drop height the same as in trial 1. This change in weight made the car go much faster and had the most total energy at 2934 joules. This happened because gravity as I previously mentioned, is always pulling down, when it gets the car to go down it will at faster speeds than lighter cars.
This is why you should have the highest drop height, a hill just a little less than the drop height, and the biggest car you have.",1,1,1,1
"            On the roller coaster that the Gonzales family decides to make, there needs to be multiple things that are there to make the roller coaster run smoothly. And be able to make it back to the start safely. Adding a whole bunch of hill and loops will make the roller coaster super fun and exciting. But, adding the features that will make the roller coaster safe is necessary while building a roller coaster. So on the roller coaster the Gonzales family builds, add a hill that is very very close to the initial drop height but just a little bit shorter. Then, it has enough energy to make it over the hill. Having a cart with more mass will also help the roller coaster have more total energy. And more total energy will make the roller coaster better. 

            The first variable that needs to be included in the roller coasters track/design is the initial drop. If there is a hill on the roller coaster track, the hill needs to be shorter then the initial drop of the roller coaster. I learned in my data that when the initial drop was 4 m, and the hill height was 3.25, the roller coaster made it over the hill. When the initial drop was 4 m, and the hill height was 5, the roller coaster did not make it over the hill and it didn't make it to the end of the track. So when building the roller coaster, add a hill that is shorter then the initial drop but still pretty big. 

            When the initial drop height was higher, the more total energy it had. In my data I found that when the release height was 2 m, the potential energy at the top of the hill was 821 J and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 820 J. When the release height was 4.75 m, the potential energy was 1950 J at the top of the hill and the KE was 1949 J at the bottom of the hil. So that shows that the relationship between release height and PE is when the release height is higher, the total energy is higher. 

           The relationship between KE, PE, and total energy, effect the ride because when the ride has more energy the higher the initial drop is. The amount of KE and PE will ALWAYS = the amount of total energy no matter where you are in the roller coaster. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy can not be created or destroyed so the amount of total energy at the top will be the same of energy at the bottom. So if the roller coaster wants to have a ton of energy, having a really tall initial drop would be the best way to do that. 

           The amount of PE at the top of the hill was always more then the KE at the top of the hill in the trials that I did. But as the roller coaster went down, the energy switched to KE. At the initial drop in my trial when the drop was 4 m, the potential energy was 1642 J, at the bottom of the hill it all converted over to KE minus 1 J. 

            The mass of the cart effects the KE and PE. When the car weighs more, the more KE and PE the roller coaster is going to have. In my trial, when the car weighed 44 kg, the total energy was 1723 J. And, when the mass was 56 kg, the total energy was 2193 J. So that shows that the more mass the cart is the more energy the roller coaster is gonna have. So, the more energy the better, so making a cart with more mass would make the roller coaster better. 

            When making the roller coaster, make a cart with more mass and a higher initial drop. Using my data this proves that the higher the initial drop the more energy it has which the more energy the better the roller coaster. Having a cart that weighs more also provides more total energy. Adding a hill is a good idea but if the hill is taller then the initial drop height then the roller coaster would not make it over the hill and to the end.

"My proposal is this, you allow my team to give you an idea that could save your business  and open a new attraction to your park. my team has been working on this idea for a while now and we think you'll like it, it is called the Top Thrill Dragster. It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the costumer's eyes. Our starting height of 4.5 m and car mass of 52 kg will always make it to the end of the ride with a hill in the middle of 4.25 m. With this height and mass, our ride starts with 2298 joules of PE, that changes to KE when at the bottom of the drop and making it over the hill and to the end with ease. The total energy of the ride being 2298, this does not change because the law of conservation energy stating ""energy cannot be created nor destroyed."" Even though PE and KE might change, this does not effect the total energy. The mass of the car, being 52 kg, makes it so it can make it over the hill because, the more mass you have, the more energy you have.",0,0,1,1
"Dear Mr. and Ms. Gonzales,

My suggestion for your roller coaster would be to make its drop height high. Making its drop height high would not only give it time to build velocity but also let you add more loops or hills to the track after the drop. The velocity would increase because the higher the initial drop height, the higher the amount of potential energy there is. Potential energy transfers into kinetic energy as the car drops from the initial drop height because of the Law of the Conservation of Energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed, so the potential energy becomes kinetic energy. If you decide to add a hill, remember that the hill height must be lower than that of the initial drop because energy can't be created, the car won't gain enough energy to make it over any hills larger than the initial drop. Also note that the mass of the car will be a factor in the amount of total energy there is. A heavier car gains more potential energy than that of a lighter car. This is because of gravity and the velocity the heavier car gains. In the end, the choice is yours, but I would recommend that if you want a faster coaster, make the car weigh more, but if you want it to be a little slower, make the cart a bit lighter. Most importantly, make sure you make the drop height high and never make the hills taller than the initial drop height.

"Dear, The Gonzalez Family 

I think the best roller coaster we could build would be a roller coaster with three hills and two inversions. Both inversions would come after the two of the hills, the hills would be all in different parts of the ride. There would be enough potential energy to get over all hills and inversions. The initial height would be 120-150 feet, the weight of the coaster would be 80-100 kilograms to give the most speed through the ride.

"Dear, the Gonzales Family 
I have been doing a lot of research on roller coasters. I believe that my idea would be a great addition to your park, attract a lot more people to come to your park. 
       The first thing is height everyone is looking for a tall, fast, stomach-dropping ride. I came up with is the ride will have a 4.05(m) release height. At the top of the release drop the PE will be at 1585(J) and the KE will be at 0(J). At the bottom of the release drop now the PE is at 1(J) and the KE is at 1584(J). 
       The total energy changes from PE to KE, Many times throughout the ride. This makes it speed it and slow down

"Dear Gonzales family, for your new roller coaster you will have to add a higher dropping point and a smaller hill than the drop. You will have to follow the Law of Conservation of Energy. The more the car weighs the more energy you will have in total.

The higher the drop point affects how much PE and KE you have while on the ride. When the drop height is lower than the hill height the car will be unable to make it over the hill. When I drop the car at 5.00m height the PE at the top was 2443j. At the bottom, the KE was 2442j. Another drop point was 2.50m the PE was 1222j at the top and the KE was 1221j at the bottom. This proves that the higher the drop point is the more energy the roller coaster has. When the drop height was 4.50m and the will was 5.00m the car was unable to make it to the end of the track since the hill height needed more energy than the drop. This helped us decide where we should start our roller coaster and where to put the hills.

Energy cannot be destroyed or created. When a car is dropped at 3.50m the PE was at 1710j and the KE was at 0j. As the car moves along the roller coaster the PE transfers into KE. Once the car gets to the bottom of the roller coaster the KE is at 1710j and the PE is at 0j. This shows us how the energy doesn't go away and more energy is not created. Since no energy is lost or added you follow the law of Conservation of Energy.

The car that had the most mass had more total energy than the cars with a smaller mass. When the weight of the car was 45kg the total energy was 1964j. The car that weighed 60 kg had 2642j. This proves that the more mass you have means that you will have more energy. When you have more PE you will start at a higher drop and have more total energy than the roller coasters that have a shorter drop. This means that we should start our roller coaster at a higher drop. 

When you are building the new roller coaster make sure that the hill height is smaller than the drop. You will also need to keep in mind that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Also the more the car weighs the more total energy it will have.",1,1,1,1
"Dear the Gonzales family,
     Hello! I am writing to you to discuss the best roller coaster design. Our roller coaster is the best option for your theme park. This is because it will go the whole length without stopping and keeping the riders safe. 
A good roller coaster should have a higher drop height than any of the hills, a heavy car, and a high drop height. If the hills are higher the car will be unable to make it over. At the top of the hill the car has the max amount of potential energy (PE) and the greater the mass of the car the more total energy your ride has, the more hills you can put in. As you go up the hills the more PE you have and as you go down the hills that becomes KE. The reason you want more total energy is because none of that will be lost, the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only change. So no matter how great the PE or KE is you will always have the same amount of energy. The science behind having a higher drop height to help have more energy is because the higher the drop height the more TE. Proof of this can be found in an experiment done by someone at Deforest area middle school. They found that the drop height of 4.5m had 293 less joules of PE than the drop point of 5m. The height of your hills can also affect the roller coaster. Another study done by someone at DAMS showed that the hill has to be less than the initial drop height. They also found that the higher the hill the more PE it has at the top. The  hill with a height of 4.5m had 589 more joules of PE than a hill height of 3.51m. The more mass your car has the more total energy, this was proven by yet another student at DAMS. They found that a car with a mass of 55 kg had 254 less joules of PE than a car with a mass of 60kg. Overall in order to have a successful roller coaster you need to have a high drop height, hills shorter than the initial drop height, and a car with a heavier mass. Thanks for considering us to build your roller coaster, we can help make it fun and safe to make the theme park the best it can be!

"Dear Gonzales family,
I hope this letter finds you well. My team and I have discovered much about the physics of roller coasters in the past couple of days. Here are some important things for you all to know:

Firstly, the higher the initial drop height is the more potential energy the car will have at the top and the more kinetic energy it will have at the bottom of the coaster. Assuming nothing else is different between the coasters a coaster with an initial drop height of 3m will have more energy than a coaster with a drop height of 2m and less energy than a coaster with an drop height of 4m.

Additionally, when a car is at the top of a hill there is only potential energy and no kinetic. As the car moves down the hill that potential energy begins to convert to kinetic energy and by the time the car reaches the bottom there is only kinetic energy and no potential. The total amount of energy will stay the same.

Something important to understand is the Law of Conservation of Energy. It states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed only converted from one type to another. This means that the total amount of energy that a roller coaster car possesses will stay the same no matter where it is on the track, however the amount of kinetic and potential energy may fluctuate. The energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted, so when the amount of potential energy goes up the amount of kinetic will go down and vice versa.

Another thing to know is that the more mass a roller coaster car has the more potential energy it has at the top and the more kinetic energy it has at the bottom. Assuming nothing else is different between the coasters a coaster car with a mass of 50kg will have more energy than a coaster car with a mass of 40kg and less energy than a coaster car with a mass of 60kg.

Possibly the most important thing to know is that a roller coaster car cannot reach the end of the coaster if it has a hill that has a height that is higher or equal to the initial drop height. There simply is not enough energy for the car to make it up a hill that is taller than the initial drop height.

The big takeaways are that a good roller coaster has a high initial drop height, a car with a large mass, and doesn't have any hills with heights higher than the initial drop height. I look forward to working more on your coaster in the future!",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales Family, 
If I were to design a roller coaster for Gonzales Park. I would make it known for its speed and its enjoyability before you ride. It would be called the Godzilla to kinda reference the name of the park and it would have a room that you enter showing the backstory about Godzilla and how he is today. Then they will move into a room where they take an elevator to a platform where the ride starts. Then it will have a gassed-powered start to make it go from 0-70  in 1-2 seconds(We will give a warning of course). Then with all the extra PE, it will then have a 40FT drop turning the PE into KE making the slingshot off into a loop. And then a 360-degree turn and then go into a hill which the ride would not be able to go up. Then the ride would start to move backward back through the 360 turn and back through the loop and back to where they started. This ride won't only bring many more to the ride, it will bring many to the park. I think this ride could change the entire future of this Park and changed the entire future of your guys' lives, and many more think a ride like the Godzilla would be one of the best decisions of your life.

"If I were to design a roller coaster for the Gonzales theme park, i tell them the height of the initial drop must be higher than the hill that comes after it because if is not, the amount of total energy would be the same for both hills and with all the Potential energy, it still wouldn't be enough to get to the top of the hill. The relationship between kinetic energy and potential energy is at the top of a hill there will be more potential energy than Kinetic but as the car moves down the track the Potential energy and Kinetic Energy flip and at the bottom of the hill is where the Kinetic energy will be more than the potential energy. So if the hills were the same height it wouldn't have enough total energy to get to the top of the second hill, which is why the initial hill should always be higher than the additional hill. 
I would start with a higher initial hill so the higher it is the more total energy it will have and then it will go faster and be able to clear the additional hill in front of it.",0,1,0,0
"Dear, Gonzales family

The roller coaster design I have come up with will be a great addition to the park as my roller coaster is long, scary, exciting, has tons of inversions, a huge hill, a corkscrew, and rings of fire. The coaster will be made from titanium and the cart will be made from wood and weigh around 60kg. We will drop from a world record height of 500 feet through a loop with a hole in it. Then we will get pulled up 600 feet by magnets to a drop down into a loop that leads into a corkscrew and into under ground where you go upside down twice before coming to a stop. While the cart shouldn't be able to make it up the 600 ft hill since there isn't enough kinetic energy we will have magnets shoot and then pull you up. At the top of the hill there will be tons of potential energy since its very high up and the cart is very heavy. But when we get to the bottom of the drop there should be very little potential energy and tons of kinetic energy since the potential energy transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy should help us get through the loop. we will get over the jump in the loop using magnets to keep the cart at a precise spot so there are no fatality's. Once through the loop the magnets will help us get to the top of the hill then when we are at the top there is a spot for people to get of if they don't wish to continue. Once all passenger who don't want to continue are off the cart now full of potential energy, drops having its potential energy transform into kinetic. Once at the bottom it will go through a loop into a cork screw and go under ground through to inversions to where magnets bring it to a stop. This is why the roller coaster i have come up with will be a great addition to the park.   ",1,0,1,0
"Dear Gondolas Family Some co-workers and I plan on trying to help you make a roller coaster ride for your park we found some things to help that I will tell you in the next few paragraphs.

We think that the smiler would be a great addition to your park. We have tested a few things and the first thing I would like to discuss is the height that I think is best for your roller coaster. So we can make this ride the best ride for the riders we should make the height for the initial drop 5.00. The initial drop should be 5.00 because the PE at the top of the drop was enough to let it get over hills for example the PE at the top was 2443 and at the bottom KE was at 0. This shows that we will have enough energy to send the cart at fast speeds.

Another thing we should discuss is the height of the hill I think the height of the hill should be 3.00. I think it should be 3.00 because it is low enough that we have enough KE to get over the hill. We have 518 KE at the bottom of the hill which will go down the more we go up and go up the more we go down so it's enough to help us get over the hill. But make sure that your hill is smaller than your drop or you won be able to make it over.

The last thing I think we should discuss is the mass of the cart. We should have the mass of the cart at 50. The cart should be at 50 because the bigger the mass of the cart the faster we go. The cart's PE at the top of the drop was 1566 and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1952. So I think we should have it at 50 because then it's the perfect weight to get the cart to go fast and still get over the hills.

In conclusion, I think you should the Smiler to your park. Because it has the perfect hill height to give riders that thrill. It has the drop at the start to get the roller coaster moving. And it has the perfect mass of the cart to give the riders the feeling that they are going fast.",0,0,1,1
"In this letter of recommendation, I will go over why my roller coaster will be fun, the science behind it, and what are the requirements for the roller coaster cart to get to the end. I believe that a roller coaster with more total energy will be better for the riders and the hills have to be smaller than the initial drop height and to have the most speed the mass of the cart has to be very heavy. 

To have more energy the height of the initial drop must be high. I know this because in all of the tests I have made the higher the drop is the more total energy is involved with the simulation. I know this because to have more total energy you have to have the chance for kinetic energy. One good way to have lots of potential energy is to start high up in the air. This causes the cart to have lots of potential energy because as the cart goes down the drop the kinetic energy will build up. I know this is the case because, in my tests for my initial drops, I made the release height 4.07 m and the potential energy at the top of the drop 1987 J, and in a different test I made the height 3.6 m and the potential energy was 1759 J. The only problem is that one drop isn't going to make a fun roller coaster you still need to add some hills to it. I did just that. I kept the highest height I experimented with and added hills onto it four different times. My tests concluded that the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop. This is because when you have a set amount of energy that cannot be created or destroyed stated by the rule of conservation, you have to stay within the boundaries of the amount of energy you have on the coaster. If you were to add a hill higher than the drop the cart wouldn't be able to get to the end because the cart wouldn't have enough kinetic energy. I know this because in my research I played around with four different hills and I came across only one cart that didn't make it over and the height of the hill was 4.07 m other than this hill the cart made it over all of the shorter hills. This proves that you have to have a smaller hill than the initial height of your coaster if you want the cart to get to the end. Another way to add more speed and thus add more total energy would be to make them as heavy as possible. I know this because in my testing I kept the same initial drop height and the hill height of 3.05 m and changed the weight of the cart four times and figured out that the more mass the cart has the more total energy there will be on the coaster. This is because if the cart has more mass it will pick off more speed thus creating more kinetic energy and friction giving off more heat energy. In conclusion, I figured out that the potential energy plus kinetic energy is equal to the total energy in the coaster.",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family, your roller coaster is in great progress. So far, we've learned that the initial drop height should be as high as possible- the more energy, the better. We decided on an initial drop of 4.5m, because it allows enough energy for the cart while keeping the ride exciting. As for the hill after the drop, we plan on making the height as high as possible. According to our data, a hill height of 4m is the perfect combination of safety & fun. We've just completed testing on the car mass. A heavier car will create more energy. Keep in mind, the final design may vary from these plans after more trials & testing. 

That's all for the updates, but we want to bring up a few key points. First of all, to make the ride exciting, as I mentioned before, we need as much total energy as possible. At the top of the initial drop, there is only potential energy, and no kinetic. At any point in the ride, the potential & kinetic energy should always equal the total energy, thanks to the law of Conservation of Energy. This supports the idea that the initial drop height should be as high as possible. For both the initial drop & hill, the greater the height, the more energy. Once the car starts moving, the kinetic energy goes up and potential energy goes down. For example, in our first trial we used an initial drop height of 3m, this gave us 1466J of energy to work with. But when we used 4.5m for the drop, the total energy went up to 2199J. This proves that the greater height, the more energy. This is true for every trial. Additionally, the greater mass, the more energy. For example, when we tested a car mass of 50kg, the total energy was 2201J. When we went up to 60kg, the total energy also went up to 2641J. Finally, when the car is moving down the drop or down the hill, KE goes up and PE goes down. That's it for now! Let us know if you have any changes or recommendations.",1,1,1,1
"       When designing a fun roller coaster, there are many important factors to keep in mind including speed and height. But it is possible for a hill to be too high to climb and that some weights allow the car to move faster. Knowing the limits of what is possible in a roller coaster just involves knowing a few rules.
       One of the rules is that the taller the initial drop is, the more total energy the roller coaster cart has. According to the Initial Drop Data, the 2 meter drop had 782 total Joules while the 5 meter drop had 2443 total Joules. At the top of the hill, all of the Joules were PE. As it was going downhill, it started transferring to KE until it was only KE at the bottom. Furthermore, the 3 meter drop had exactly 391 more Joules than the 2 meter drop proving that higher hills have more energy which lets you get more velocity and faster speed.
       Another important rule to abide by is that any hill must be shorter than the previous hill's drop. With an initial drop of 3 meters, the car successfully climbed a 2.97 meter hill, but failed to climb the 3 meter hill because it had 0 KE before it reached the top. Likewise, the car didn't climb a 5 meter hill, but did climb a 2.5 meter hill. As long as the hill height is less than the drop height, it will have enough KE and the cart will be able to pass. 
       Lastly, the more mass a cart has, the more energy it has allowing for more speed. For example, the 40 kilogram cart had 1175 of PE Joules at the top of a 3 meter drop and 1175 Joules of KE at the bottom. The 60 kilogram cart had 1761 Joules on the same drop. The heavier carts will have more velocity going downhill allowing it to gain more speed and KE.
       All in all, to design a fun successful roller coaster, you just need speed and height. Heavier carts give you more speed and energy while slower carts do the opposite. And when adding hills, the hill just needs to be lower than the previous drop. The trick is balance. Once you figure out what works, everything blends together into a wonderful ride. ",1,1,1,1
"I recommend that the Gonzales family could make the roller coaster last longer to make people think that they are getting their money's worth. I also recommend that they make it more fun as well and hear how i think they can do that. First what they could do to make it last longer is have it go in loops so that the Gonzales family don't have to make the roller coaster long itself, just the time. What i mean by that is instead of them going around the track only one time, the Gonzales family could make it go around two time instead. A way that they can make it more fun is adding more twist and turns to their roller coasters. An idea for a roller coaster is that they can use a boost to boost the cart up 5 meters and add a few hills starting at 4, then 3.5, then 3, and so on until 2. The reason why i think the initial drop should be 5 meters is so that the cart has enough energy to make it over the 4 meter hill. And then after the car makes it over the 4 meter hill the drop will be giving them enough energy to make it over the 3.5 meter hill. And then after the car makes it over the 3.5 meter hill it will have enough energy to make it over the 3 meter hill and then it goes on and on. So that is my ideas to the Gonzales family to make their roller coasters better.",1,0,1,0
"There are many contributing factors and variables that go into designing a roller coaster that will be functional but still enjoyable for the rider.

A non negotiable factor for the best possible roller coaster design would be a decently high drop height. The initial drop height of the coaster has a huge impact whether or not the roller coaster will work. The initial drop height affects the amount of total energy present. The greater the height of the initial drop the more total energy. (PE+KE=TE) At the top of a track that has a higher initial drop height there is a larger amount of PE present (there would be 0 KE present). At the bottom of that same track there will be the same amount of total energy, just converted to KE. This is due to the fact that, at the top of the track the car is not in motion and therefore storing energy. This is the reason that all of the present energy is PE. There is all KE at the bottom or end of the coaster due to the motion of the coaster. The higher the initial drop, the more total energy there is. The date I collected proves this because in a trial where the initial drop height it 2m the total energy is 1067J. A trial with an initial drop height of 4m has a total energy of 2124J.

If a hill on the coaster is too tall, the car will not make it over. There would be no KE when it got to the highest point of the hill because the car wouldn't be in motion. In a trial with the hill height of 5m and the initial drop height of 4.5m the car didn't not go over and had 0 KE and the highest point it could be on the hill. If it did make it over the hill then the amount of KE and PE at the top of the hill was dependent on the height of the hill. The total energy would equal the amounts of KE and PE. At the top of the Initial drop there is 0 KE, the car's not in motion. At the top of a hill there is an amount of KE due to the fact that the car is in motion. The PE at the top of the initial drop equals the  PE+KE at the top of the hill. Any hills on this coaster need to be lower then the initial drop height for the car to go over.  More energy is required to get over a hill that is taller than the initial drop height. The law of conservation states that energy can't be created so when the initial drop height is lower than the hill there is not enough energy for the car to go over the hill.

This roller coaster car also will need a decent amount of mass. The more mass the car has the greater the amount of total energy.  A greater mass allows the car to move faster, the faster the car is moving the more energy it has. A car having the mass of 60kg moves faster along the track compared to a car with the mass of 40kg. The greater amount of energy has to come from somewhere, as the law of conservation says, energy can't be created or destroyed. In this case the energy come from a greater mass and therefore a greater speed.

As mentioned before and clearly highlighted here, there are many factors that go into creating the perfect roller coaster. Even a slight mistake or change in certain aspects of the coaster could affect the integrity making the coaster not able to be ridden, therefore it is extremely important to be precises and understand the science behind making a roller coaster work.

"Here are some recommendations I would give you for your roller coaster. The higher you make the start the higher the energy is going to be the more fast and fun the rider will have. At 5 meters release height, the total energy is 2932, the energy is higher than 4 meters release height which is 2346 total energy. The drop height needs to be higher than the hills so that the car can get over. Ke + Pe = Te. Energy cannot be created in a closed system, so you must ensure you have enough energy to get over the hills. One to get more energy is to make the hill higher. Another way to get more energy is to make the car have a higher mass. A car with 60kg has 2937J of energy while a car with 42kg only has 2054J. The car at the top of the hill stopped has all of its energy as potential energy waiting to be spent. Once it has reached the bottom of the hill all of the Pe turns into Ke. Throughout the ride, the total energy remains the same. My design follows the requirements for energy with the drop being higher than both of the loops the cart can successfully make it to the end. My design is fast and fun with a high drop height and a heavy cart. Please choose my design.",1,1,1,1
"There are many things that need to go into the design of the roller coaster to make it safe, working, and fun. In this essay, I will be showing you what you need to include in your design and other facts to know about when it comes to energy and roller coasters. 

First off, when considering the height of the initial drop of the coaster, the initial drop height impacts the total energy of the roller coaster. The higher the drop height, the greater the potential energy will be which will then raise the kinetic energy and also the total amount of energy of the coaster. In trial 2 when the release height was 4 meters, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2145, but in trial 1 when the release height was 5 meters, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2443. This shows that when the height of the roller coaster is increased, the potential energy goes up. 

Secondly, at the start of the track, the PE is bigger and then when the coaster is going, the KE gets larger. And then at the end of the ride, the KE is bigger and the PE is 0 or 1 so then the total energy is bigger. In trial 5, when the release height was 4.5, the PE at the top was 2410. But as the car moved down the initial drop, the PE changed to 1 and the KE changed to 2409. This happened because at the top of the roller coaster, there is a ton of stored-up energy (PE) in the car because it's not moving. But then when the car starts to move, the stored energy is then put into motion, bringing up the KE and lowering the PE.

I also know that anytime throughout the ride on the coaster, the PE and KE will always equal the total amount of energy, even if the PE and KE change. For example In trial 3 when the release height was 3.75, at the top the PE was 2023 and the KE was 0 and then at the end of the ride, the PE was 1 and the KE was 2022, showing that when adding the PE and KE, they will always equal the total energy. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can not be created nor destroyed, and the roller coaster ride proves this law. Because you can add up the PE and KE to get the total amount of energy, this shows that energy is never created nor destroyed during the ride. 

Another very important thing to take into consideration is that the initial drop height needs to be greater than the hill height or else the car won't be able to get over the hill successfully. And it will not make it to the end of the ride. I know this because in trial 4 when the hill height was 4.5 meters and the initial drop was 4 meters, the car did not make it over the hill. This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy can not be created, and the only way the car could make it over the hill would be for it to create more energy to move it over the hill. But, it can't because of the Law of Conservation. 

The last but not least thing that I learned is that the more mass the car has, the greater amount of PE, KE, and total energy the roller coaster will have. I know this because in trial 4 when the car had the greater mass of 60 kg, the amount of PE it had at the initial drop was 2350. And the KE it had at the bottom of the drop was 2347 and the total amount of energy was 2350. But then in trial 1 when the mass was the least it could be 40 kg, the PE was 1567 at the top of the initial drop and the total energy was. This shows that the greater the mass of the car, the more PE, KE and total energy it will have. And the car will also go faster when it is has a greater mass and slower when it has a smaller mass.

All of these ideas above are more than recommendations, they are requirements to make it the best, most safe, and fully functioning roller coaster you'll ever see. I promise that if you follow my ideas, you're sure to bring in a ton of business and have your visitors having fun for the whole day.",1,1,1,1
"the past few days I have been doing lots of test notes and data to find the best roller coaster that live up to expectation. like how the deigns will function use energy, making it to the end with out stopping, testing hills, and more. I have been test out how the weight of the car effects the ride. and I believe i have found the best design. one big thing i studied was the energy involved using kinetic energy (KE). KE is a energy that a object has do to its motion the fast the object moves the greater the kinetic energy. An object that is not moving has zero kinetic energy. then another energy is potential energy (PE). PE is stored energy. in a object do to its position its is gravitational measures is Jules depends on mass. the last energy we used is law of conservation. the law of conversation can not be created or destroyed but it can convert from one type of energy to another. all the energy works together because KE and PE are opposite so when goes down the other goes up and when you add that gives the total energy. on the roller coaster I design it starts up high in the air and the PE is very high do to the initial drop high. because The higher initial drop height the more PE and on the bottom there is more KE. the coaster we use is the heavyset coaster sitting a 60kg we did this cause the higher the mass of the car will give it more energy the 60kg car had a total energy of 2356. But the 40kg cart only had 1567 total energy. Because the wight of the car weighs it down to go faster. Then strait away that is very fast. It is a huge drop then there is a litle hill half the size of the drop. it is that size because the drop height has to be higher then the hill in order for it to go over and not go backwards. throughout the ride the total energy stays the same then on the bottom of the hill there is a big loop that uses the energy from the hill. Then there is three more little loops and when thats over you rap around to the bottom and that will be the end of the ride. my ride meets all of its requirements people who are pregnant. I call my ride deklan. hope you like it.

"Dear Gonzales Family: I have informed you that your new roller coaster is going to be built in such a manner that it will for sure function correctly without friction. My idea is that we start off the coaster really high up and have 3 loopy- loops, that will have the rider facing the ground three different times and then add a hill at the end that the roller coaster will overcome.

How will this work you may ask. It is easier than you might think, the coaster cart will be a total of 60 kg so it will have more energy. It will then start first with a 5(meter) initial drop height, this will follow up with a turn turning all the potential energy into kinetic, then will come its first loop. At the top of the first loop it will be a height of 4 (meters). I know the roller coaster will overcome this obstacle because, as long as the initial drop height is taller than than the loopy-loop it will have no problem going through it. Next comes the second loopy-loop. This obstacle is 3(meters) tall at the max point. The roller coaster will get through the obstacle because it is carrying its same energy as the initial drop height. Because in the Law Of Conservation it states energy cannot be created nor destroyed, meaning it would have the same amount of total energy, however there will be a mix of both potential energy and kinetic energy. Then comes the third loop. This loop has a height of 2 (meters). The roller coaster will have no problem going through this considering the Law Of Conservation will be in play. Lastly comes the 4.75 (meter) hill at the end of the ride. This is where all potential energy shifts toward kinetic energy to try and make its way up the hill. to get back to the start line this hill curves very hard to the left making the roller coaster go up the hill at a slower pace, but still making it to the top of the hill. But you may be thinking how can it get back up the starting point if they are at 2 different heights. While as I stated earlier the Law Of Conservation states energy cannot be created nor destroyed. Making it impossible for the roller coaster to make it back up to the starting point. So we added an elevator, where once the coaster is on top of it and has no more kinetic energy it will pull it back up towards the top until it is at 5(meters) high. It would then be the next peoples turn to go

In the end Science and the Law Of Conservation proves that my roller coaster will be fully functional and everyone will have a blast going on it.",1,1,1,0
"Dear Gonzales Family, I propose that the total amount of energy at the bottom and top of the initial drop should be the same but the KE and PE should be different. For example, in trial number 2 the amount of KE is 0, the amount of PE is 1466 and the TE is 1466. This was at the beginning of the ride, when PE and KE are added they should always equal the TE. At the bottom of this same ride, the PE is at 1 and the KE is at 1465, when added they equal 1466. This shows that the total energy stays the same the whole ride. The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is true because the total amount of energy in trial 2 stays the same the whole time, while the energy is transformed from PE to KE.  

When a hill is added to a rollercoaster the hill's height has to be less than the initial drop or the car will not make it over. For example in trial number 3 when the drop height and hill height are the same, the car doesn't have enough energy to make it over the hill. This is because it doesn't have the extra energy from the initial drop because it already used it up trying to get over the hill that is the same height. When a rollercoaster car goes down the initial drop and then up a hill, the energy is converted back and forth from KE and PE. This happens in trial number 2 which states the PE at the top of the initial drop is 1958 and the KE is 0. When the rollercoaster car reaches the top of the hill it doesn't come to a complete stop the PE is 1228 and the KE is 727, the total energy stays the same. This shows that the energy is converted from KE and PE because no energy is added or subtracted. 

The mass of the rollercoaster car also affects the KE and PE. For example, a car of 40kg has a total energy of 1567 while a car of 60kg has a total energy of 2350. This shows that the mass of the rollercoaster car affects how much total energy there is. 

In conclusion, the roller coaster should have an initial drop higher than the hill, and the mass of the roller coaster should depend on how much energy you want the ride to have.",0,0,1,1
I believe that my design or the Gonzales roller coaster would be the best. Because it is tall will attract an audience so will attract more people and they will make more money. What I believe is the best for them to do is make a roller coaster with a tall drop height example 5.00 m. The higher the drop the more PE it will have the smaller the drop the less PE it will have. A hill will be added to slow down the coaster so it has a smoother ride to the end. The hill height will have to be something smaller than the initial drop height because the coaster will not make it over and people will not want to ride the coaster. So the hill will be small enough for the coaster to cross over it will have less kinetic energy when it reaches the top of the hill KE. And about half the PE it had at the top of the drop making it safer. While the roller coaster is going down the hill that pe from the tall drop is turning into kinetic energy which means that the energy that can be potentially stored up is being used. And potential energy means how much energy can be in an object another thing to keep in mind is that the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It only transfers from the two different types. Another thing is that the more mass the coaster has will also affect the PE and KE of the coaster. More mass means more PE and more KE so I believe that the mass of the coaster shouldn't be too heavy or too light. That is the reason why the Gonzales family should choose my roller coaster.,1,1,1,1
"My teams roller coaster will be one of the most succsessful coasters in the whole park because, not only is it fun and thrilling, it has the science behind it to help make this ride a thrill.

The way my ride works is as you are about to board you are brought to the first drop of my ride. This drop is (in my model) 5.00 m tall, in my research when  my intial drop height was 5.00 m tall it produced 2443 J of PE before the drop. As you the rider gets through the intial drop and going down you will hit the first hill. This hill is 2.50 m tall. I made this hill this height so as you get up the hill you will not be losing a tone of KE. This means our ride will go faster because as our car moves down the track all of that PE on the top if the intial will convert into KE. This was proven in my expirement (intial drop) there was 2443 J of PE at the top of the drop, at the bottom of my drop the PE was at 1 J and the PE was at 2442. The energy all adds up this because of the law of consevation of energy wich states that energy can not be created or destroyed it just is converted. I made this drop so the KE would have enough J of energy to get over the hill. see I did this because in one of my expiremnts I made my hill to big (5.00 m). When the car was going up the hill all of its  KE was converted to PE and the car was stuck and had no motion. All of my stored up PE started to convert back to KE as the car started to roll back down the hill. This showed me that the hill height had to be less than the drop height. There is one last thing I had to make sure to mention is the mass of my car. I made the mass of my car in my model 50 kg to give it more PE to convert to KE to really make sure it will make it over. See I tested three cars will three different masses 40 kg,50 kg and 60 kg. As I tested these weights I noticed that the higher weights had the most J of energy. I belive this is because as the car has a higher mass it makes the car more dense this making the weight of gravity pull down on it causing more energy. I chose 50 kg to be safe to make sure it gets over and to make sure it dosent go to fast. This is what ive learned about my coaster.",0,0,1,1
I would recommend that the Gonzales family try our coaster because it is fun and exhilarating. The reason our coaster will be awesome is the initial drop is pretty high at the height of 3.75 meters. This will create a lot of speed and g force making the ride fun and exciting. You then go up a hill with a height of 2 meters. You will have more then enough kinetic energy to make it to the top of this hill. I know this is true because in my trials. I found that if the initial drop is higher then the hill you will have enough energy to get over the hill. This is shown in trial 1 of adding hills where the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 2 meters. In this trial the coaster makes it to the end of the track. Where as in trial 3 the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 4 meters tall causing the coaster to be unable get over the hill. This shows that my teams coaster would make it to the end because the hill is shorter then the initial drop.,1,1,1,0
"Dear Gonzalez family,

I have a proposal for the design of your roller coaster. Using what I have learned about mass, height, and the laws of physics I know how to make the fastest, safest, and most fun roller coaster possible.

My proposal is to make a roller coaster with the highest initial drop height possible. Doing this will give the cart more energy. I know this because of the first experiment I conducted on the relationship of energy and height. The first trial had a release height of 2.4 m. This height produced a total energy of 1220 J. The last and highest trial had a release height of 3.5 m. This height produced a total energy of 1708 J. With a difference of almost 600 joules it is easy to see that higher is better for maximum energy and fun.

Another important factor is the mass of the cart. Not to be confused with weight, mass is how much there is of an object. A cart's mass may seem to not be important, but it actually can have a great affect on the energy of the ride. My third experiment gave me trials to prove that a bigger cart is better. The cart with the least mass of 46 kg had 1570 J of total energy, while the cart with the most mass of 60 kg had 2054 J of total energy. 

One last detail on the coaster are the hills. A roller coaster is much more fun with swerves and bumps. But I recommend the design is conscious about the affect hills have on the coaster. My second experiment provided trials on how high a hill can be an the cart still makes it over the top and to the end. I learned that a roller coaster's hills cannot be equal to or greater than the height of the initial drop. This is because of the law of conservation of energy. This law tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This means that during the ride, the total energy available will stay the same. When the cart drops its PE is converted to KE, and as it climbs up the hill KE is converted to PE. Once all the KE is converted to PE the only way it can move is back down. If the hill requires more KE than the cart has to spend, it will not make it over the hill. I know this because of my second experiment, where the first 3 trials of 2, 2,5, and 3 m hills all allowed the cart to go over as soon as the release height equaled the hill, the cart did not pass over.

In conclusion, the secret to the best roller coaster is simple. Use a high release point for maximum energy, use a large mass cart to add more energy, and keep the hills low enough so the cart can pass through.

"During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my finding about the best way to design a roller coaster. To design the best roller coaster you have to have an initial drop higher than your hill size. The drop height of my roller coaster is 4.15 meters. This is important because for the car to be able to make it to the top of the hill the initial drop has to be higher than the hill height. 
For example, when I tested the drop height of 5 meters, the PE was 35 Joules. When increased the drop height to 4.15 meters, the PE increased to 2432 joules. 
PE+KE=TE 
My data supports this equation because my roller coaster had 1j of PE at the bottom of the initial drop, it had 2930j of KE at the bottom of the initial drop, and it had 2932 j of total energy at the end. ",1,1,0,0
Some recommendations that I think will be helpful for the Gonzales family is my huge roller coaster thats exciting and fast my reasoning comes from my data that I pulled from the roller coasters. My data from my first roller coaster. My first test is the release height the number is 3.49m then the pe at top of initial drop and the number is 0 the ke top of inital drop is 2437 then the pe top of hill is 1706 ke top of hill is 741 my total energy is 2447 and it did made it to the end. Now my second trail's hill height is 2.50 pe top of initial drop is 42 and the ke top of initial drop is 2401 pe top of hill is 1214 and ke top of hill is 1228 the total energy is 2443 and it did made it to the end. my third trail's hill height is 2.50 the pe top of initial drop is 1 ke top of initial drop is 1233 and the pe top of hill is 1221 ke top of hill is 2 and the total energy is 1223 and it didnt made it to the end. So the best one would be the second one.,0,0,0,0
i choose fun to have a bigger drop,0,0,0,0
The initial drop must be higher than the hill because the data show that 5 meters can't go over 5 meters hill.,0,0,0,0
"Over the last week or so we have been studying what will be the best roller coaster and we have come up with some things that have limits before there are opposite reactions.

Initial drop has to be bigger than the hill so that it can make it to the end. The potential energy should be the same because you use the same drop height.The greater the mass the bigger the total Energy. 
The lower the mass the lower the Energy.

My ride would be better than any ride. Because it starts at a drop and does a loop and goes straight and goes fast up a hill which is smaller than the drop, because then it would not make it up the hill and then you just be rocking back and forth.

 PE and KE changes when the car moves down the hill is different and depends on the car weight but it does not change that much but it does change.

I learned that the higher the roller coaster  the higher the total energy it will be. For example the 3.98 m roller coaster will have a 1946 J of energy but the 5.00 m roller coaster had 2443 so that proves the higher the roller coaster the bigger the energy and vise versa.

That mass and energy are related and can be changed from one to the other.

That concludes that there is a lot that goes into a roller coaster like how high is your drop, are there loops,are there hills and they can't be taller then the Initial drop or it wont work. I believe that my roller coaster is the best roller coaster out there please pick mine!

"Dear Gonzales family, I think you should pick my design for the roller coaster you want to put in your park and here is why. The ride will be fun and exiting but, also safe for everyone. I have learned with my experiments that I have been doing that you want the initial drop height to be higher so, it can produce more energy. I learned that you should have the initial drop height be higher than the hill you have on the roller coaster. And you want to have a car mass that is greater so, more energy will be produced.

I found that the initial drop height should be high because there will be more energy that is being produced over the drop. When the car is moving down the initial drop height there is more KE being produced over the ride. Data I found when I was experimenting was when the car was released at the height 5 meters, the car had 2442 Joules of KE. But, at the drop height of 3 meters, the car had 1465 Joules of KE at the bottom of the initial drop. This data shows that there was more KE at the end of the ride for the higher drop height of 5 meters. 

I found the initial drop height should be higher than the hills because the car has to have energy to make it to the end. I found the height of the hill has to have less PE at the top of the hill than the PE at the initial drop. My data shows that all of the hill heights that were less than 4.5 meters worked. But the 5 meter hill height did not work because PE at the top of the hill was 2202 J. And the initial drop height's PE at the top was 2199 J from my initial drop data. Also, in my trials where the hill height 5 meters did not make it, but the lower hills made it to the end. This shows that if the hill height is taller than the initial drop height then, the coaster won't make it to the end. 

I found that the mass of the car has to be heavier in order for the car to gain energy as it rides. I found that the more mass there was in the car, the more energy there was. In my trials I found that when the mass was 45 kg the total energy was 1992 J. But, in my trials where the car was 60 kg the total energy was 2644 J. This shows that the greater the mass the more energy will be transferred over time.

You should choose my safe, fun and, exciting roller coaster. The roller coaster should have a higher initial drop height, a hill that is lower than the initial drop, and a mass that is heavy. I hope you pick it because it will be the best design for the park and your customers.

"My teams roller coaster design will be exciting and make it to the end without stopping because it has many drops that are bigger than the loops. This will make the cart reach the end because the drop needs to be taller than the loops for the cart to make it all the way around. I know this because in my testing data, the lower the hill compared to the initial drop, the more total energy there is. This is because the cart doesn't need as much energy to go around these loops or hills when they're smaller vs when they're bigger, also giving it more total energy. It will also make it exciting because in the ride It'll go around loops and up hills faster giving it more of a thrill. I also believe this because of how fast my teams roller coaster will go. Knowing that most people who go on roller coasters love the fast ones, we made ours fast. In the beginning, you go through a dark tunnel then unexpectedly have a huge drop giving you that adrenaline rush. This drop will give you lots of power to go up the hills and loops after that. I know this because the higher the initial drop the more total energy there is. The higher the drop means more PE at the top of the ride and more KE at the bottom. The PE and KE also is affected when the cart goes up and down our hills. Because one of our hills are smaller than the other, it is more likely for the cart to get to the end. But the higher the hill, the more PE and KE it has. There is less PE and KE when the hill is smaller. I know this because in my data I collected, My 5.00m hill had 2327 PE and 2 KE, meanwhile my 3.15m hill had 2324 PE and 777 KE. My 3.15m hill made it all the way meanwhile my 5.00m hill did not. This is because the initial height (4.75) did not have enough energy, nor was tall enough, to push the cart all the way up and down the hill. These different initial drops effect the PE, KE, and TE because the higher the drop the more PE and the lower the drop the less. This decreases the KE, and the KE and PE equal the TE which effects the full energy. These energies effect each other because the energies can NOT be created or destroyed. It transforms itself from one to the another and that is why the PE and KE effect the TE. The mass also effects the ride and energy because when the mass is greater, it has more energy and the lower the mass the less energy. I know this because in my data, the more the cart mass, the more PE it has which means the more KE it has. For example, one of my carts had the mass of 60 and had the PE of 2790 and the KE of 2772. This cart had more mass than my other cart which had the mass of 43 and had the PE of 1981 and KE of 1978. This shows that the more mass of the cart, the more energy which means the cart is faster and better and why you should choose my teams roller coaster.",1,1,1,1
"Hello, Gonzales family! In order to make a thrilling, safe, and working roller coaster, there are some factors that need to be taken into consideration. That includes a tall initial drop, a hill that has a height below the initial drop, and putting more weight on the cars.

The first step to creating a roller coaster is to start with an initial drop, and the higher the better! Initial drops matter, and are important to set the stage of making an incredible roller coaster. The more energy your track has, the quicker the track will be. Speed is a factor many thrill seekers love, so it's key to include it in your track. The higher your initial drop is, the more energy there is. This can be concluded by the simulation I created and recorded. At the highest height of 5 m, the energy was higher compared to all of the other trials. As the drop height slowly decreased, the energy did the same. This shows that more height will give you more energy, which will improve the entertainment of the roller coaster.

An initial drop isn't all that needs to be added. To help make the roller coaster more exciting, a hill needs to be added. However, you can't just choose random heights for your hill, because if you want your roller coaster to complete the track, you have to follow some guidelines. The initial drop has to have a taller height than the hill, because there is only so much energy in a track, and won't be able to be completed if it requires more. During my simulations, my data helped prove this theory, by looking at the same drop height and changing the height of the hill. I set my initial drop height at 3 m, and attempted a hill at the same height of 3 m. There wasn't enough energy from the drop height, so the track was incomplete. However, when I lowered the hill height to below 3 m, there was enough energy for the car to complete the track. This shows that in order for the roller coaster to be completed, the initial drop has to be taller than the hill.

Lastly, car weights on the coaster need to be considered as well. The more weight the car has, the more energy! In our simulation we experimented with different car weights and how it affected how much energy there was and the roller coaster performance. At the car weight of 46 kg, our lightest car, the total energy was 1350 J. Then adjusting the weight to 60 kg, our max weight, the total energy was 1761. The weight changed the amount of energy drastically, and comparing the two, it's significantly more noticeable. The statement the the more car weight the more energy was true to all the other statements as well, the weight improving along with the energy. The data shows that the more car weight, the more energy.

In conclusion, these factors need to be included in the roller coaster design. A high initial drop will give the roller coaster more energy-and a bigger crowd buzz! The hill height will have to be slightly shorter than the initial drop in order to be completed at the very least. The car weight will help increase the energy and speed which helps contribute to a more enjoyable ride! These characteristics will improve the quality of the ride and ensure the safety of riders. Thank you for you time!",1,1,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family, you have requested a roller coaster, and I have the best one for you. See, for a roller coaster to be exiting and reach the end, it will first need an initial drop hight, the best hight found, was 4.00 meters. It will also need a hill to make it exiting, but the hill will need to be a lower hight than the initial drop hight to ensure that the cart makes it to the end of the ride. I found in the simulation that 3.75 meters is the best option. 
The higher the initial drop hight, the more PE it will have at the top, then the energy will transfer into KE at the bottom because energy cant be created or destroyed, only transfered. But in the end, there will still be the same amount of total energy. At 4.00 meters, my roller coaster will have 1958 J total energy. 
The hill will be 3.75 meters, this ensures that the car will make it to  the end because it is a lower hight than 
the initial drop. The energy gets distributed throuout the ride and at the top of the hill, the car will have 1844 J PE and KE but then at the end there was only KE left. This would not have worked if the hill was 4.52 meters because there would be 1960 J PE at the top of the hill, thien it will go back to the beginning of the ride, because it is too tall of a hill.
If the car is much heavier, it will have a lot of energy, but it wont have as much if it is light. The best mass for the cart, is 50 kg this made it so the total energy was 1951 J. If the cart had less mass, it would not have as much energy, for example, a cart with a mass of 43 kg had 1701 J total energy. This does not effect how the energy gets transfered from PE to KE at all. 
I hope you feel that my evidence on how hight of initial drop, hight of the hill, and mass effects the energy, and weather or not the car will make it to the end, has convinced you to chose my roller coaster design.

The reason why the roller coaster would work is because its initial drop height 3.50 is higher then the hill height 3.25.The reason that is because if the hill height is higher there will not be enough kinetic energy to make it up the hill.For example when i did the roller coaster simulation i had a trial where i set the initial drop height to 3.50 and the hill height to 4.0 the cart could not make over the hill but when i kept the drop height the same and lowered the hill height to 3.25 it got over the hill . the reason that the hill height must be higher is because as it came down the hill potential energy transfers to   kinetic energy allowing it up the hill. And another thing that helps is  more mass  when something has more mass the more kinetic energy it has is higher  at the bottom and it would make it go faster up the hill. For example in my trial the drop height for both simulations was 3.50 and the hill height was 3.25 and when the 60 kg  cart had 2054 jolts of potential energy while the 40 kg had 978 witch proves the heavier the cart the more energy making it easier to get to the top of the hill. In conclusion the design i will be fun and work because the the drop height is higher then the hill height,0,0,1,1
"Dear Gonzales family here are my recommendations for you to make the best roller coaster possible for your park.
First the roller coasters initial drop cannot be lower to the ground than the hill that is coming afterwards.
 In my simulation the cart that was on the initial drop that was lower than the hill afterwards didn't make it over the hill.
Second the higher the initial drop the better.
In my simulation when the drop height is higher the more PE the cart had, PE makes it more likely that more KE.
When PE goes up KE goes down when KE goes up PE goes down this relates to law of conservation of energy.

Law of conservation of energy
that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It can only transform from one form to another.

Third make the cart heavy.
In the simulation the greater the mass the greater the total energy,less mass the less the total energy.
   
So of you apply all of this to your roller coasters it will surely be fun and safe for everyone.",1,1,1,1
"during my proposal to the Gonzales family. Also,  for example, when testing the drop height of  3.68 meters the pe was 1979 but when I increased the drop height to 4.45 meters the pe was increased at 2391 joules. Also, The total energy of a system, including a roller coaster, is the sum of its potential and kinetic energies. It represents the overall energy content of the system at any given point during the ride. The conservation of energy principle ensures that the total energy of the roller coaster remains constant throughout the ride, neglecting any energy losses due to friction or other external factors. Also, the drop height of my roller coaster design is  4.45 meters this is important because it makes the roller coster fast and goes up the hills and making it fun and not a boring ride. ",0,0,0,0
"I would tell the Gonzales family to have the initial drop at 4.00 m. Because the drop is at 4.00 m the hill height can be either 4.00 m or anything under that because of the drop. Regarding the mass of the cart, I would say to have it at 55kg because you have more PE at the top of the hill. Once you go the KE at the bottom of the drop is the same number as the PE at the top of the drop. Because of the Law of Conservation of Energy, which states energy can not be created nor destroyed, the energy gets transferred as you go down the drop. In one of my trials, the initial drop height was 4.00 the TE was 1955, the TE of the hill height was 1959 and my car made it. The mass of my cart was 40 kg. So you should make your initial drop at 4.00 m. Your hill height should be at 3.69. And the mass of your cart should be about 40 kg.",0,0,0,0
"The Gonzales family should choose my roller coaster design because it's not only exciting but it will also be safe. My roller coaster is going to start with a high drop so energy can be passed through and make the ride fast and fun. Most roller coasters start with a chain to pull them up but my roller coaster will start with an initial drop of 4.0 m. The amount of PE at the top will be 1955 J and the KE at the bottom will be about 1954 J. It won't be too low because if it is, there won't be enough energy for it to go over any of the hills.

 On the topic of hills, my hill will be about 3.52 m high. The height of the hill should always be shorter than the initial drop. If not, the car may not make it all to the end or even over the hill. So the shorter the hill, the more of a chance to make it over. 

My car will have a mass of 55. The PE at the top of the drop will be 1959 J and the KE at the bottom is 1956 J. The total amount of energy at the end will be the same as the PE (1959 J).

"Hello Gonzales family, I will be talking about how our roller coaster design will be the best for your entertainment. Roller coasters need some way to get energy to make it to the end of it. Some may use power-boost energy, and others can just use physics. Lets make a roller coaster that uses physics.

Now how does a roller coaster use physics? Well, lets start off really high from the ground so we can use gravity for our power source, also known as the initial drop. The initial drop is the starting point, the higher it is, then its a better chance at making it to the end. Along with the initial drop, there is also an energy called ""Potential energy"", that is going to be your start energy (Also your end!). Once the roller coaster starts moving down your initial drop, that's when things start to get fun.

When your cart is moving down hill, the PE(Potential energy) and the KE(Kinetic energy) start to switch. One  decreasing and one increasing. The one decreasing is going to be the PE, while the one increasing is going to be KE. Both the PE and KE are measured in J(Joules).

Now for my first example, the initial drop is going to be at 5.0 kg, with the cart being 50 kg, the PE at 2443 J and the KE at 0 J. Once the cart starts to move down, both the PE and KE start to decrease and increase. When the cart is all the way at the bottom of the initial drop, then the PE and KE should be completely flipped around(Start: PE=2443 J, KE=0 J/End: PE=0-1 J, KE= 2443-2442 J (PE+KE=TE(Total Energy))).

Now adding a hill to the ride can be a little difficult if measurements are off to some extent. For one, the only way that a roller coaster can making it to the end with a hill is only if the hill is shorter(In height) from the initial drop height. If the hill is the same height or higher then the cart doesn't have enough energy to go over the hill without extra support.

Mass is also a very important factor in physics. For example, car A has a mass of 50 kg and car B has a mass of 60 kg and the same initial drop being at 4.0 m. Once the car is finished which every the car had the greater the mass, more the total energy. And the one with lower mass, then it has less energy.

In conclusion, to make a roller coaster using physics, you must include:
- Initial drop.
- A hill that is shorter than the initial drop.(If included)
- Make sure the car gets enough energy to make it through the end.",0,1,1,1
"I think that our roller coaster is the best design because we have done tests and we have figured out the only way it will make it to the end is that the initial drop has to have the greatest height out of everything. You will not have enuff PE to make it over a hill/loop with a greater height than the initial drop. Another thing that would help the car make it all the way through is more mass. We have done some tests with mass we first tested a car with 40kg its PE was at 1763 then we tested a car at 60kg its PE was 2644 almost 1,000 differences in PE just because of mass. We also did some tests with the initial drop and we tested the height at 2.50M it had a PE of 1222 and then we did another test but the height was at 5.00M it had a PE of 2443. Then we did some tests with hill height we first set the initial drop to 4.50M then we added a hill with a height of 2.50M when the car reached the top of the hill it had 1226 PE and 974 KE which means it was still moving at good speeds and made it to the end. More KE more faster the car is moving then we took a hill with a height of 5.00M and the initial drop is still the same height of 4.50M and when the car was at the top of the hill it had a PE of 2200 and a KE of 5 and the car was not able to make it over the hill because the hill was higher than the initial drop. This just proves that more height more PE more mass more PE the initial drop has to be higher than the hill or I won't make it over the hill. Now this is way I think you should use our Roller Coaster. ",1,1,0,0
